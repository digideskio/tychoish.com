Pedagogy

In the comments to my :doc:`career pathways
</posts/career-pathways>`, Bruce drew out the connection between
teaching and scholarship (or intellectual practice.) I would like to
explore pedagogy in more depth, both as part of the series on
scholarship on the :ref:`blog-posts` and independently on the
wiki. This page may move around on the wiki.

Formal Classes
--------------

I'm interested in teaching formal writing classes. While I don't
really want to teach freshman writing to anyone, I think it would be
pretty interesting to help train professional writers. The basic
descriptions of the course, goals, and inspiration for the ideas
follow.

If anyone is interested in taking one of the classes described below
or finding a way to get me in front of actual students, I'd love some
help and support here. Be in touch. Also remember that this is a
wiki. I'm aware that these thoughts are pretty rough on my initial
pass, so please do edit.

Blogging Intensive Workshop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm convinced that the thing that made it possible for me to "be a
writer" is my blog. a practice of writing regular posts for a few
years taught me how to take any morsel of an idea and write a few
paragraphs on the topic. Blogging taught me how to sense audience,
even if I haven't responded well to that audience. 

I think it would have been great if I had a class in college that
said: write 3 or 4 posts in a blog a week (which is a lot,) about
various topics (some of your choosing, some not.) Do that for four
months. Get the content out onto the internet, lead discussion
threads, and just see what happens. Students would, by the end:

- Have experience with voice. The only way to be able to write clearly
  and effectively as *yourself* without becoming bogged down in
  affected prose is by a lot of practice.

- Write more clearly and more concisely. Shorter, clearer blog posts
  are more successful than longer ones. That's a huge part of the
  form, and four months and ten or twenty thousand words to learn this
  seems pretty speedy. Having to write regularly, and at volume, makes
  it easier to figure out how to improve core communication skills.
  
- Learn how to edit and polish your own writing, *sufficiently* to
  avoid distracting from what you're saying (one of my biggest
  challenges,) without developing an obsessive complex. 
  
- Reflexively communicate an idea in a brief essay or note, without
  second thought. There's a difference between being able to have a
  conversation about an idea or taking some ideas and build an essay
  (eventually) and "real writing." Turning conversations into
  arguments and ideas automatically is really key. 

Long Form Text and Collaboration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In college, I learned a lot about how to write a lot of different
kinds of papers. I can probably still auto-pilot thought anything from
"about a page" to about 10-20 pages. And maybe I wrote a paper
something that was 30 pages on a single project. But I never wrote
anything longer than that in school. As a result I never really
learned how to write and manage longer structured texts, and these are
exactly the kind of texts that are the core of professional writing,
and arguably good academic writing as well. I was also unprepared for
working as/with an Editor in realistic situations.

The basic plan for the class is to present an outline of a book on
day-one, and have the class develop a method and a plan to complete
the book by the end of the semester. The course would spend a few
weeks covering the material for the book and talking about the
research process. But after a week or two (at most,) I'd turn into a
project manager for the rest of the term to help them write and edit a
manuscript. The learning objectives/major writing lessons:

- How to think about writing as a top-down process (moving from
  chapters to collections of sections and paragraphs) rather than
  bottom-up (moving from words, to sentences, to paragraphs.)

- How to edit other people's work. I think of this as "caring about
  sentences."

- How to let other people rewrite your work and learn from the
  experience. There's a lot of effort and work that goes into
  preventing cheating in academic writing. The end result is to
  enshrine the right of the author to have full control of their text,
  which isn't realistic or particularly productive.

- How to draft effectively so that other people can build on your
  work. Drafts can and should have notes to yourself to "write more
  about a particular idea," they can have unfinished sections, and
  they can have sections that get left on the cutting room
  floor. Drafts can have sections that are just collections of quotes
  and links. Drafts aren't just fully written versions in need of a
  little polish. 
  
  While I like the idea of "turning in a draft," to a professor as a
  way of ensuring that students have some sort of writing process, I
  think the truth is that most drafts don't look enough like a paper
  for this to be a useful exercise. 

Writing as Teaching
-------------------

Another thought, separate from teaching formally, is that much of
writing I'm doing contributing to tychoish.com is pedagogical
itself. While it's not always been intentional, a great part of my
writing here attempts to explain topics, draw connections and ask
leading questions. After all, that is basically what the best seminars
do anyway.

Technical Writing as Pedagogy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Technical writing is largely a pedagogical practice. The overlap
between good rhetorical and technical skills is not as uncommon as
good technical writing skills. While being able to communicate
technical concepts is a challenge, the "magic" lies in being able to
understand your audience and tailor documentation and resources to
their needs. That is at it's core a pedagogical exercise.

And that's just in "conventional" technical writing (comprehensive
manuals, specifications, API reference materials, release notes.) I'm
increasingly convinced that most of the words spilled by technical
writers are actually far *more* pedagogical: training materials,
procedural guides, technology overviews, white papers, and so
forth. It's all teaching people about something. 

Blogging as a Teaching Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My blog posts: present an idea, (hopefully!), a little background or
context, a few resources as links, and a whole slew of
questions. That also describes many college lectures, or at least the
best ones

So maybe, following from Bruce's comments the teaching element of my
:doc:`intellectual practice </posts/intellectual-practice>` is already
established. I still want to explore it more, but it's a starting
point.
