Hi friends. I hope that this Monday morning finds you well. I'm feeling
better than I have in days, and even though I've been awake for almost
forty minutes, I've already started to accomplish things. How cool is
that.

I haven't posted about `my reading
list <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/new-year/>`__ lately, mostly because I
haven't really been reading. Well. I read a little in the Tiptree
novel/novella series that I've been working through for a really long
time: *The Stary Rift.* It's good. Maybe I'm at a low point in the
story, but this one isn't quite as good as *Brightness Falls from The
Air* but it's still good. Both books are set in the same world, and
there's this nifty framing story that presents all the plots as
historicalized records, which I hardcore like.

I also read a story by Greg van Eekhout "`In the Late
December <http://www.strangehorizons.com/2003/20031222/december.shtml>`__,"
which I quite enjoyed. I went through the `Strange
Horizon's <http://www.strangehorizons.com/>`__ fiction archive and
picked out all the stories by authors whose names I recognized. Mostly
the folks who have made it on the `Strange Horizon's
Podcast <http://www.strangehorizons.com/2007/20071029/podcast-e.shtml>`__,
but some others as well. Anyway. So I'm going to be working my way
through those.

I'm winding a bit of handspun off the spindle onto a nostopin (which
takes for-bloody-ever, by the way). Though an end is in sight. I'm
liking the spindle, and I think I'm probably about... 4 times faster on
the wheel, depending on weight. Which sounds bad but probably isn't
very.

I posed, just before this, `a little bit from this hypertext/novel
*thing* that I've been talking
about <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/breakout-messages-lost/>`__, which is
exciting and a little scary. Any thoughts you might have on it, would be
very welcome.

I think that's all the news that isn't. On the list for doing today:

-  Some Email Correspondence
-  Do some more readings.
-  Upgrade various Wordpress installations.
-  Work on the short story.

And so forth. I'll catch you all around.

Onward and Upward!
