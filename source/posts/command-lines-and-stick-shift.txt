=============================
command lines and stick shift

once upon a time everyone knew how to drive manual transmissions,
because thats all there was; just like once upon a time, everyone knew
how to write code and use command line interfaces because thats all
there was.

Now we have
`GUIs <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface>`__ and
automatic transmissions.

Stick shifts can sometimes function as a sort of rudimentary security
system: not as many people know how to drive them, less
demand/competition, less expensive, and therefore less likely to be
stolen.

Might, command lines, eventually take a similar path, that they become
less hackable because people are less likely to know how to use them?
