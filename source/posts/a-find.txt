There's a Catholic church not very far from our house, that has a very
good rummage sale every year. Actually there are, I think at least three
Catholic churches that are closer, but thats a geographical quirk, and
is neither here nor there.

So, of course, we went.

We have the theory, that for the best rummage sale experience, go to
rummage sales in neighborhoods where the mean household income is
greater than your household income. As crap is relative, this has proven
to be a good rule of thumb.

The corollary to this rule is that you shouldn't go to sales in places
that are too much better of than your neighborhood, as the likelihood of
*those* people overpricing their crap relative to *your* means is too
high.

Anyway, in accordance with these rules, we have always been fond of this
sale, and this year didn't disapoint. Here are the highlights.

- Worsted Weight Wool in good shape from the 50s and 60s. I'm going to
  make socks and hats.
- About ten old science fiction magazines. I going to start with a F&SF
  from October 1978 that has a `Thomas M.
  Disch <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/thomas-disch/>`__ story in it,
  though most of what I picked up are from the last 10-12 years.
  Including some older `Cory Doctorow <http://craphound.com/>`__ stuff
  that I think will be interesting to read.
- A basket for holding spinning stuff while I'm spinning.
- A couple books and maybe some other stuff that I'm forgetting, but
  odds and ends.

I'm pretty pleased with this, on the whole. Reading the fiction will be
a lot of fun. I'm doing better with the reading, but I think supporting
the magazines more, and reading that material is something that I hope
will be good for me as a writer. I'll report on it here of course.

Onward and `Upward <http://criticalfutures.com/>`__!
