As my `previous post <http://tychoish.com/posts/wolf-424/>`__ probably
indicates, I've been reading wikipedia recently about fairly elementary
astronomical concepts and facts. While this is an enjoyable project all
by itself, it's clearly in service of the fiction I'm writing.

I'd also take a moment to note that in the biggest web traffic I've
gotten in a month or more due to a post I made on
`zimmermania <http://zimermaniacs.blogspot.com/>`__, and the `pictures I
posted yesterday <http://tychoish.com/posts/casbah/>`__, I'm going to
have a post about science fiction and near-Earth star systems. *Sigh*

Anyway back to Wolf 424. All this is all well and good, but the truth
is, I don't write hard SF, and to say that I have a somewhat tenuous
grasp on mathematics. Nevertheless, reading about stars which are pretty
close on a cosmic scale, is something that I find really helpful and
inspiring for my writing.

I think because thinking about `Barnard's
Star <http://en.wikipedia.com/>`__, or `Wolf
424 <http://tychoish.com/posts/wolf-424/>`__, `Epsilon
Eridani <http://en.wikipedia.com/>`__ is about leaning into a sort of
existential sense of wonder and amazement. I mean. Wolf 424 is
moving--relative to the solar system--at hundreds of miles a second. I
mean wow.

So that's what I think science fiction should, in an ideal world aim to
communicate, I mean, among other things, of course. I made the point a
few weeks ago that, space opera should attempt to make going Alpa
Centuari, or Vega being substantively different than going to Montana or
Nepal, even if the story is mundane, even if the boundaries of realism
are pretty flexible.

My two cents at least.

Onward and Upward!
