still no news.

I have myself convinced that if I don't get a rejection slip by 1pm in
the time zone that the school I'm waiting on, my chances of getting in
go up, and continue to go up with every successive half business day, on
the theory that as long as I'm in play, my chances go up: other people
on the wait list ahead of me are more likely to have made alternate
plans as time goes on, and so forth.

This is all speculation, of course, but if it makes me feel better, I'm
taking it. I'm about as frayed as I ever get, though I think I'm
*almost* faking it pretty well. Almost.

My first trial run with the nalgene french press when poorly, though I
totally blame operator error, and I'll give it another try.

llThe new spinning wheel is, simply put, amazing. I spun 3.75 ozs of
singles this morning, still the BFL that I've been chipping away at for
months, and I'm working on the second bobbin. `My
mom <http://www.twitter.com/momtron>`__ reminded me that we got 8 oz of
spinning fiber (alpaca wool? alpaca wool, silk? brown? I think.) for
christmas, and I might take my share of this when I'm done with the BFL.
Which will probably be in the next week or two. After that, I want to
make an order from `R.H. Lindsey <http://www.rhlindsaywool.com/>`__, to
get some corriedale and merino and maybe some other this and that,
though I'm intrigued, they have uncarded grey merino loose wool that
might be fun. And if I got a flick carder, the processing might not be
such a bother. And its grey, which I'm fond of. Anyway, it rocks.

Ok, I'll be in touch, of course.

love, tycho
