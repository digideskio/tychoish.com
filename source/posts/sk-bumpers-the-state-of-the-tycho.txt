I meant to add some bumpers to `Tuesday's *Station
Keeping* <http://tychoish.com/posts/station-keeping-first-arrival/>`__
installment, but I seem to have failed with that project. Here are the
bumpers that I'm adding, for your enjoyment.

I've been killer busy, and I think I've probably driven a good bit more
than 1000 miles in less than a week. It'll probably be more than 1500 in
a bit more than a week. Crazyness. On the upside, I've managed to get
unstuck enough to really concentrate and get things done, writing wise.
This is very good, as I tend to value my sanity. But anyway...

Before the story.

Welcome to *Station Keeping* this is the second installment in our
first "season" of this project. It's fiction, collaboratively
written and planned: set in the distant future, station keeping
tells the story of the residents and visitors to a space station
called "Hanm Centre" far away from the populated core worlds. As you
will read, this episode introduces a number of important characters
in this story, on the eve of their arrival on the station. I hope
you enjoy, and if you are interested in contributing to this project
we are interested in hearing from you. Your feedback is always
welcome and is most appreciated.

And after the story.

"First Arrival" was written by,
`tycho <http://tychoish.com/tychoish>`__, the creator of
`TealArt <http://tychoish.com>`__ and [Station
Keeping](http://tychoish.com/hanm"). He is a student and knitter by
day and a science fiction writer by night.

I think I need a better bio tag.
