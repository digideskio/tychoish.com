*tycho:* So I like what I'm doing, but I think in a few years I'm going
to start thinking about how to go back to school to do science studies
work or anthropology.

*Ben:* Ah, that's cool, so what do you *really* want to do? [*implied:
with your life*\ ]

*tycho:* [**Laughs**\ ] Really? Marry a couple of doctors and write and
edit science fiction, I think would be pretty nice.

*Ben:* uh...

**pause**

*Ben:* Did you hear about `Paul
Newman <http://www.stuff.co.nz/4708643a12.html>`__?

*tycho:* Anyway, so I was chatting about work/career stuff with this guy
and I mentioned my eventual plan to go back and do anthropology/science
studies grad school, and he was like "so what do you really want to do,"
and I said "marry a couple of doctors, and write and edit science
fiction full time," which is the best possible answer to this question I
think. Given that *no* one really knows what they want to be when they
grow up. And if you're basically talking about winning the lottery, you
might as well aim high.

*Scott:* Not a bad plan... Let me know if the doctors want a 4th in the
mix!

**pause, and tycho smiles**

*tycho:* wait, I think you just proposed to me. [**laughs**\ ]

*Scott:* Well... technically I proposed to the hypothetical other two...
you're just along for the ride.... **ahem**

*tycho:* Right, and fair enough, really. But you wanted to be #4, and
I'd be #3 and which gives me some sort of veto power or hypothetical
precedence in the hypothetical decision making. [*pauses*\ ] it's not
every day that you get accidentally proposed to...

*Scott:* Ooops

[*pauses*\ ]

*tycho:* I'm *so* blogging this.

*Scott:* **facepalm**
