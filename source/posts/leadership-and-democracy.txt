Leadership and Democracy
========================

I was listening to `FLOSS Weekly <http://www.twit.tv/FLOSS>`__ this week
as I was running about, and there was a bit in one of the episodes about
leadership and organization of open source projects.

Not being much of a programer *at all*--but being very interested in,
for lack of a better term, the anthropology [1]_ of open source
projects--this sparked a larger interest. Lets back up for a moment.

Some of the larger (and apparently smaller ones as well?) open source
projects like Perl, Python, and the Linux Kernel are lead by sort of
"benevolent dictator," types who guide development, make decisions about
release dates, provide vision, and are generally responsible for some
major part of the code. [2]_ These are typically the people that started
the project, though I think there are some second/next generation
leaders of projects, (Matt Mullenweg of WordPress [3]_ for one.)

And this is interesting, because we generally think of open source as
being this incredibly democratic space where users and developers can
all sit on the same level and say "this is what I think," and have their
voices heard. [4]_ Right? I mean isn't being able to shape the direction
and tools of your (technological) experience, sort of what democracy (in
this sphere) is about?

Of course it is. Democracy isn't about voting and contentious power
struggles with small margins, democracy is about a group of people
making it possible for different perspective to be heard. So to put it
in parliamentary terms: it's the debate/discussion, not the vote that
matters.

And here you thought I was going to post something about the current
american political debacle? Pass. Not because I don't have opinions (I
do,) or because it's not fascinating (it is,) but because *there's
absolutely nothing to say.* That kind of "democracy," isn't by this
definition particularly democratic and doesn't have as much impact on
the way we live our lives as the other kinds of "micro-political"
democracies that we are constantly participating in. Many kinds of work
environments are democratic in this way, after a fashion, and many other
small groups, like dancing, craft-related, not for profits, grassroots
organizations, have strong (and potentially static) leadership and
vibrant discussion, which nets a very democratic result.

I think this is a continuation of some of my earlier postings on open
source, but I think will also be part of a new (irregular) series of
posts on leadership, because there's so much to talk about and so little
room (and time.)

I think the major ideas that are running through my head are:

- the difference between power and leadership
- how democracies scale up and scale down to different group sizes.
- the symbols associated with democracy, and the power of those symbols
(maybe this could develop into a post for `the theory
blog <http://www.theorysmucks.com/>`__, nu?)

I really enjoy thinking (and talking!) about these sorts of *political*
notions, but I'm always disappointed by the shape that most "political
discussions" take. So here's my attempt to take back the night and start
a more frank (and productive discussion.) What's leadership to you, and
what kinds of successes and failures do you all see in your own
microdemocraies? [5]_

So, anyway, think about that, I look forward to hearing from you, and
there'll be more knitting content soon; I promise.

.. [1]
I suppose this could be the sociology of open source, I'm
uncommitted, particularly at the moment, on the subject. I'm just
interested--idly mostly--in how these communities organize and
motivate themselves. With some exceptions this kind of organizational
structure isn't really supposed to work, but is so clearly does. It's
not my *thing*, but it's interesting.

.. [2]
They said that these were all "first name people," as they're really
well known, and generally pretty well liked in the community, and
thus refered to only by their first names. eg, "Lary," "Guido," and
"Linus."

.. [3]
He'd be a good one for FLOSS Weekly. Hrm.

.. [4]
I think your chances of being able to get mysql to add/support a new
feature that you want (even if you have to write it yourself) is
light years beyond the chances of getting Oracle, for instance, to
add the new feature.

.. [5]
So, one thing that I want to squash immediately is a discussion of
interpersonal drama, which though often political in content,
particularly in numerically small groups is not particularly
political in nature. For instance, the rumor is that there's
generally a lot of "kernel politics," and drama in the linux kernel
development (and other sorts of drama in other parts of the linux
world,) and while this *might* be a product of these communities
growing too large or of weak(er) leadership than is required, it's
probably the case that this kind of drama is a byproduct of
"community" rathe than the byproduct of any particular organization.
