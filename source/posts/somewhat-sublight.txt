I got my `hair cut last
friday <http://flickr.com/photos/tychoish/2744789963/>`__ and while I
was waiting for my turn in the chair, I did a little writing with my
`ipod touch <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/ipod-touch-review/>`__, which
was an experience onto itself. [1]_ But this is a post about what I
wrote, not how I wrote it...

In recognition of `my need to work on a new
story <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/in-between-ness/>`__ I began to work
on developing a new story. For the past year or so I've been working in
a much "harder" context than I might otherwise be prone to. No
`FTL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light>`__, no aliens, and
if we ignore station keeping, no alien worlds, no terraforming, and
nothing more than say 500 years in the future. I mean I'm not
particularly rigorous from a technical perspective, and while I have a
rough grasp of `Hohmann Transfer
Orbits <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit>`__ and
`Lagrangian points <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_Point>`__ I
don't exactly do the math to check if there'd be a fuel efficient launch
window arriving on Mars in "late 2542."

Also at issue is the experience of my first-highschool-era novel which
was very FTL/military/alien worlds/terraforming/etc and as I went back I
found all that absurd.

So I figure, I have a fiction blog, I could write something short, play
with a world briefly with hyperspace and aliens and what not, and if it
sucks, it'd be over soon enough. So I sat down, and began to write some
notes for the world and for the character that I want to (re)use.

Guess what?

No FTL. Alien worlds and terraforming, and outlandish technology on the
interstellar ships, but no FTL.

It seems that no matter what I do I *really* want to write stories about
isolated populations of people, because that's where cool things
surrounding group identities/histories develop, and if people can hop on
a ship and be "home" in a week or two, the creation of new worlds
doesn't provide a cultural situation that is fundamentally unique from
our current globalized world.

Sigh.

Thoughts?

Onward and Upward!

So it went well. I'm clearly not very fast with the keyboard, and I
don't think that I'm missing something by not having hardware keys,
but once I learned to just "go with it," rather than worry about
accuracy, I think I got more accurate, because the corrections were
spot on. It's smart. Here's the thing that sucks. There's no good
text editing program. I'm using `Endnote <http://www.endnote.com/>`__
which has good syncing but but it's a bit... rough. I think in the
future, if I try and break from my "take notes in one giant text
file," it might work a little better.
`Alan <http://macromates.com/>`__, it wouldn't be too much to ask for
for an ipod textmate? maybe with git hooked up as a plugin? Thought
so. Anyway.
