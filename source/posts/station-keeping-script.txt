I just wrote a script for station keeping. it's 6 pages and about the
length of our usual installments. this means I have to write 1-2 more
installments for the current season/run.

It's formated like screen play, and frankly it's designed to be read.

I just think that drama is an interesting form. Anyway, it's pretty
nifty, just thought i'd share.
