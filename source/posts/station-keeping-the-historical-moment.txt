*Welcome to this week's somewhat late edition of* Station Keeping *I'm
sorry about the confusion this time. We'll return to our usual schedule
next week. This episode was fun for me, it gave me a chance to explore
story telling from an historical perspective, which is something that I
think is pretty nifty. With luck this won't be the last you see of Prof.
Tiltsten, and I hope that this essay will help explain some of the
questions that you might have about the station and our story.*

The Necessity of Hanmist Studies, Part I
----------------------------------------

*by Professor Jonathan Tiltsten*

Unlike some other pivotal moments in the development of human colonial
efforts on other worlds, many documents survive from the period just
before and during the occupation of a space station in-orbit of the
rim-world "Hanm." Though in retrospect it is widely accepted, and
obvious to many scholars of post-League political organization that the
events on *Hanm Centre* were very important, if not key in determining
the organization of human government for the next hundred years; at the
time, the key actors in this milieux were not only unaware of their
coming role in history, but also the importance of their moment. First a
letter from the papers of Commander Eli Banner, the first commander of
*Hanm Centre*, written shortly before he departed for Hanm:

Sometimes I think I'm getting too old for field assignments, but
it's better than getting fat and old behind a desk core-side, a
lowly commander would never get chosen for a relativity cruise
cycle [1]_. But I'm basically unattached, and I have some experience
in the field, but who knows anyway. This time period never did suit
me, and it'll be interesting to see how the world looks on the other
side. A of a long flight; not that the core will matter very much
out there I trust. I just hope I get a chance to come back someday.

At the same time, the leaders of the civilian government on the colony
world Hanm knew that change in the status quo, at least for their
people, was imminent--and strictly speaking, it was--their opposition
was to the league presence on *Hanm Centre,* not, in their mind, to the
entire League, as it would later become. [2]_ Or the interstellar
political status quo of the previous thousand years. Indeed it we now
think that it would have been at least a generation on Hanm from the
time that Eli Banner departed the core-side world until he and his
convoy would arrive on Hanm.

This is an excerpt from an editorial circulated by early "Hanmist" [3]_
shortly the Navy confirmed that it was sending a high level operations
convoy after Commander Eli Banner left the core for *Hanm Centre*.

Above all, I would like to express my objection to the fact that the
outpost currently under-construction in high orbit of the planet
will be operated and governed by the League's Navy. While an easily
accessible space outpost in this part of the galaxy is not
inherently objectionable, I would like to locate my resistance to
*Hanm Centre* not in terms of resistance to the League at large, but
rather in acknowledgment of the fact that the Civil authority on
Hanm was not--according to the public record--consulted by the
League authorities, and furthermore, the fact that the station is
not to be administered or overseen by Hanmish authorities. Indeed,
there is no reason that it can be directed and administered by the
civil authorities on Hanm, who would surely be the best suited given
their experience with the region.

As we can see, the seeds of the "Hanmist Separation" movement were
significantly more modest than the militant movement that would follow
in their name. In an age where the technology of space travel had
paradoxically brought time and history to a virtual stand still, it took
by the standards of the day, only a paltry handful of years for the
Hanmist movement to sour. Though from our contemporary perspective this
may not seem particularly remarkable, it must have been--particularly to
the then unknowing Eli Banner.

.. [1] Key leaders of the League and Navy during this era were
   frequently cycled on and off interstellar flights to help provide
   continuity with the League's longer term missions on outer
   worlds. This kept some level of stability, but meant that policy
   changed back and forth as various leaders came on and off the
   cruises.

.. [2] In fairness, it is only in retrospect that we can make this
   claim, in a lot of ways, *Hanm Centre* was of a guilded age of a
   dying empire of sorts, and the accomplishments of the station and
   it's crew though too numerous to list here, were not typical of any
   late imperial project.

.. [3] "Hamnism" refers to the political movement started on Hanm
   (that quickly spread to other large rim worlds) that advocated
   independence and separation from the League, the policies of
   continued colonization, and distant centralized government.
