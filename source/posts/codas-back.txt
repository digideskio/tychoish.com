I just upgraded tychoish today to the new, "WordPress 2.7" which has a
great new user interface that I really like. We're finally getting back
to b2/cafelog and wordpress 1.5 ground. Heh. Anyway. I'm going to be
reviving this little mini-blog on the right hand side of the site. The
rule this time? All posts written off the cuff and nothing with
paragraph breaks. Sounds like a plan? I thought so.
