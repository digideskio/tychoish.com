Every so often I try and remember to use ical to organize things, and
keep me on track. generally it helps things, and for short periods I'm a
little bit better off.

One thing I tried, was to schedule tealart essays, because I was
generally (and in some ways still am) a few weeks ahead, at least in
terms of planning if not actual writing. It worked, and I think it was a
good exercise.

And then, I need to restart my computer, or need a few extra RAM
resources (because iCal is a hog), and I forget to open the program up
again, and lo and behold its' three weeks later and I have to start
again.

maybe I'm better out without?
