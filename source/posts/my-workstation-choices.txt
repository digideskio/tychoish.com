My Workstation Choices
======================

I've been talking in fairly abstract terms about this new workstation
that I've been setting up, and about how this fits into the general
ethos of my existing hardware setup, but I think, it's probably the
right time to interject and clarify some of the choices and
base-assumptions that I've made during this process.

- My current systems (hardware):

- A moderately powered dual-monitor workstation (ubuntu-from-Dell,
circa October 2008) that's running Ubuntu for the moment (probably
move to arch or Debian in the next few months.) This was my work
computer during the freelance period.

- A thinkpad x41t (vintage 2005); 1.4 GHZ pentium M (?); 1.5 gigs of
ram; 60gb hard drive, running ubuntu with the lenny kernel. This is
my main personal computer at the moment, as I haven't gotten the
desktop setup yet. It's a great machine, but I do feel a bit cramped
on it for heavy day-to-day useage, it's great for distraction free
writing, and portability.

- (The work computer) A contemporary vintage iMac running OS X 10.5
latest, and also running Arch Linux in Sun's VirtualBox system.

- (The infrastructure) Debian based virtual server(s), to provide my
own personal cloud (web hosting, git hosting, file syncing, remote
shell access, email).

- My current systems (software; but application centered):

- **Window Mangement:** `awesome <http://awesome.naquadah.org>`__. I
run `slim <http://slim.berlios.de/>`__ as a display manager on the
laptop, and just use startx/xinit on the desktop/virtual box
sessions.

- **Email:** I use `mutt <http://www.mutt.org/>`__ for reading email,
compose emails in emacs, sort email using
`procmail <http://www.mutt.org/>`__, download email using
`fetchmail <http://www.mutt.org/>`__ (if neccessary), but mostly keep
mail synchronized using my own
`git-mail <http://www.tychoish.com/2008/10/git-mail-3/>`__ scripts.
For sending email and smtp connectivity I use
`msmtp <http://www.tychoish.com/2008/10/git-mail-3/>`__, and I
suppose I'm using postfix on the server as well.

- **Text Editing:** I use emacs23 (still the CVS/development/snapshot
branch) of emacs (stable is v22). I use 23 because I like the
`emacs-daemon <http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com/2009/02/emacs-daemon.html>`__
functionality, and it's pretty damn stable. I have aquamacs installed
under OS X for the moment, but I'll probably install 23 soon, because
it's quirky.

- **Personal Organization:** `org-mode <http://www.orgmode.org>`__,
which is technically included in emacs (and I use whatever the stock
version in 23 is, these days.) I use org-mode for managing my todo
lists, shopping lists, project planning and appointments.

- **Shell/Terminal:** bash and
`urxvt(cd) <http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html>`__
under linux, and terminal.app on Leopard. And GNU Screen. I live in
`screen <http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/>`__.

- **Web Browsing:** I use firefox with hit-a-hint, and
emacs-key-bindings (firemacs) on linux systems, as I wait for the day
when good functional web-kit based browsers begin to become a
possibility.

- **IM/IRC/Chat:** `mcabber <http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/>`__
for IM (running ejabberd on my server with the pyaimt transport), and
irssi for IRC.

- **Linux Distribution:** `Debian <http://debian.org>`__ stable on
servers; Ubuntu-mostly on desktops with a desire to move to
`ArchLinux <http://archlinux.org>`__ for desktop use. I love debian,
but I think for my desktop-use purposes I cant find a setup that I'm
comfortable with, and while ubuntu is great (and I'm glad it works so
well with my laptop;) it's a bit heavy and makes assumptions that I'm
not comfortable with. Alas.

That's what I'm working with. Just so you know. The mocking can begin
now.
