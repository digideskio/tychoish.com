=============
Pattern Terms
=============

As I promised earlier, here is the draft of the "terms" that I want to
include as part of my pattern for the shawl. It seems reasonable, and it
seems to reflect my interests in both promoting freedom and the open
exchange of ideas, but more importantly in making it completely clear
that I'm not writing this pattern out of philanthropy.

The truth is that by refusing to restrict downloads giving away copies
of this pattern means that more and more people will be able to see the
pattern and this blog (which is, in the long term, good for me and my
pocketbook). The basic idea is that, only a certain percentage of people
are going to pay anyway, and with luck by unrestricting the download,
more people will see the pattern, and therefore a great *number* of
people will pay. I think/hope the economics work out, but we'll just
have to wait and see.

In any case, below the fold, you'll see a copy of the draft of the
statement of this idea. Please give feedback and commentary either in
the comments or via email. I look forward to hearing form you.

The rights to this pattern are entirely the property of the author;
except in the instance of this copy, in which you the knitter hold
(quite literally.) Very likely, you downloaded this pattern after
paying for it, in which case *I thank you*. But it's also possible
that you have the pattern downloaded the pattern from free from my
own website, or after receiving a copy from a friend or
acquaintance.

This is alright. I don't think it's fair to expect that you buy
patterns sight unseen, and I think that spreading copies of this
pattern to your friends and fellow knitters is *without question* a
good thing for this pattern and my design career: tell people about
this pattern.

At the same time, *this pattern is not free.* If you decide to knit
this pattern or value it's contribution to the knitting community, I
request that you pay for the pattern, and you can find instructions
for this at http://tychoish.com/knitting/. If the price is a barrier
to you, or would like to contribute more to support future designs,
there are options at http://tychoish.com/knitting/ and you should
feel free to contact me by email at garen@tychoish.com.

This means that under no condition should *you* derive profit from
the sale of this pattern or take credit for the pattern. I would
also ask that if you share the pattern that you only distribute this
pattern in full, including all charts and instruction. I would,
however, be delighted if you, after (buying) and knitting this
pattern decided to design your own eclectic pi shawl.

*Note*: This will appear as a PDF file that I expect people to print
out, hence the literal display of URLs. And by the time this launches,
the tychoish.com/knitting/ page will, of course, be configured to
contain links to pages that discuss donations and the store.

Onward and Upward!
