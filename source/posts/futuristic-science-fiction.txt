If you ask a science fiction writer about the future, about what they
think is going to be the next big cultural or technological breakthrough
they all say something like, "science fiction is about the present,
*dontchaknow* the future just makes it easier to talk about the present
without getting in trouble."

While this is true, it always sounds (to me) like an attempt to force
the "mainstream" to take science fiction more seriously. It's harder to
be dismissive of people who define their work in terms to which you're
sympathetic.

I'm of the opinion that when disciplines and genres get really defensive
and insistent in making arguments for their own relevancy, it usually
reflects some significant doubt.

Science fiction reflects the present, comments on the present, this is
**quite** true (and key to the genre), but it's also about the future.
*And that's ok.* Thinking about the future, about possibilities, more
than the opportunity for critique is (part) of what makes this genre so
powerful and culturally useful. To deny this, is to draw attention away
from imaginations of the future sacrifice distracts what probably makes
the genre so important.
