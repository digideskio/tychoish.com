One of the things I said when I closed TealArt for the first time, and
that I'm reafirming now that I've closed it *for real*, was that I would
spend more time contributing to other blogs. Because, other group blogs
are important to support, and I think in this way, it becomes easier to
support all of my various very *niche* interests, without letting
tychoish become overly burdened with any one kind of rambling.

As I've mentioned before I've done a little bit of blogging for the
`feminist science fiction blog <http://blogs.feministsf.net>`__ which is
a great deal of fun, I'm planning out and writing a post for that this
morning, which I'm sure that you'll see in due time.

The development worth noting in a blog post is the fact that finally
coerced asked a friend of mine to add me to a blog he started a bit ago
called `Theory Schmucks <http://theoryschmucks.wordpress.com/>`__ which
is sort of a pop culture meets undergrad cultural studies classes meets
political blogging. I'm not sure that I quite fit the mold for this
blog, but the co-bloggers are friends, and if there was ever a place to
stir up shit, that's it. And it could hardly be less successful/exciting
than my last attempt at theory blogging.

I'll post notes about new posts as I get them up, just announcing them
by way of saying "here's what I'm working on."

I'm also a semi-regular on the
`Zimmermania <http://zimmermaniacs.blogspot.com/>`__ blot, but I
generally only post big project reports over there.

Onward and Upward!
