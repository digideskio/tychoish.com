In my post about my `fact
file <http://tychoish.com/posts/fact-file-and-orbital-mechanics/>`__ I
said that I was going to "try things out and see how it goes" before I
posted code to see how things work in the system. Well, I think things
are pretty stable (I haven't tweaked much), so I'm going to post my
remember template, for the system described in that post.

::

   (setq org-remember-templates
      '(("data" ?d "* %^{Title} %^g \n :PROPERTIES:\n :date:
          %^t\n :cit e-key: %^{cite-key}\n :link: %^{link}\n
          :END:\n\n %x %?"  "~/org/data.org")))`

If you want to tweak further, check out the `relevant section of the org
manual <http://orgmode.org/manual/Remember-templates.html>`__.

Enjoy and collect facts with abandon!
