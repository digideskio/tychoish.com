Sorry that I'm low on creativity this morning.

I've submitted two applications today, to *IvySchool* and
*SouthernPrivateResearchSchool*, and I'm prep-ed to fill out the forms
for the third and final (*FormerGloryNorthesternSchool*). I'm going to
pick up some USPS mailer things on my way to work in a few, and get
things sent out tomorrow morning/afternoon. Everything is in order and
all that's left is a bunch of busy work left to do. That's not
unimportant, and it's a bunch of time, but I'm looking forward to
returning to human status again. Quite Happy.

I'm going to be working in the shop again today, so if you're around,
stop by. I'm going to be cutting a steek (ie, cut an armhole where
previously there was none) on demand tonight, probably at about 6/6:15pm
CST.

In the mean time, `read
this <http://www.jaredaxelrod.com/main/2007/12/20/its-what-philo-farnsworth-would-have-wanted/>`__
by Jared Axelrod, it looked cool when I clicked the link, but I haven't
gotten around to reading it, but I hope to.

Have a great day!

Onward and Upward!
