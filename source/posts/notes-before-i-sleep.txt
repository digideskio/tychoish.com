Notes Before I Sleep

1. I'm not sure if I want to take the class I'm signed up for this term.
I have 9 days to reflect on this. In *not* category, but I'm not
going to rush
2. Good response from a real grad school. "Passed the first cut" (Also,
I have to dig up college credit transcripts from things I took in
high school, which blows.) There is a possible/very likely interview.
Still not *wild* about the locale, but actually not discouraged. G.,
begged me not to go in an incredibly adorable exchange, though I
can't possibly contextualize it properly in the context of this post,
so you'll have to trust me.
3. I finished the third scene in the chapter I'm currently working on.
Started the forth. THis sounds more impressive than "300" words, so
I'm running with that. Slow and steady, eh?
4. Yarn store work has been very busy and very not-knitting related.
Which is par for the course, because there's lots of stuff that needs
doing: sock, labeling, yarn winding, pattern research, etc. And I
don't mind this, except that it leaves me sort of irritated feeling
about my own knitting, which means I haven't really been knitting
much during my off times, and because I'm busy doing other things
during the day, I don't get much knitting done a all.
5. I'm realizing that working at knitting shops makes me a very
introverted knitter. The last time I worked at a shop, a few summers
ago, I spent a lot of my free time knitting alone to sort of recover,
and thats the same sort of thing that I find myself wanting now.
6. I wore an older sweater and pair of socks that I knit a long long
time ago. It was nice, and I remember how much I liked these things.

Ok, over and out. tycho must sleep sometime.

Onward and Upward!
