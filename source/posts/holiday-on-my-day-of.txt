Is Somebody Having a Holiday on My Day Off?
===========================================

I hear that some of you are celebrating today. If that's the case, good
holiday to you, dear readers. If that's not the case, I hope you're not
too befuddled by this very strange Thursday we seem to be having.

I guess in some respects I'm celebrating. Though I often leave, the fact
that *no one else* is working changes the way the day feels. And I'm
writing today's blog post/letter this morning after having a nice
fish-brunch (it's a family ritual/jewish thing) with the family. We're
going to go get food at an Indian buffet that's near by. I'm looking
forward to it. But other than that it'll probably be a normal day. I'll
be writing, and maybe doing some work. But for now I'm just going to
write a letter to you all.

Lets see, there have been a lot of little projects that have taken up a
lot of my time and brain power. I'll outline them to show what I've been
working on and to see if anyone has suggestions:

-  I've been working on switching to a different terminal emulator
(urxvt from gnome-terminal) and I have yet to get the colors *right*,
which is a barrier. A terminal with hard to read colors is totally
useful. Also, I haven't quite figured out how to get copying and
pasting from other apps to uxrvt to work, but I figure I can just
read the documentation again, and that should be apparent. The reason
for doing this? Gnome-terminal, though easy to configure, is pretty
heavy weight, when there's no real reason for that. If I were running
one or two instances, that'd be fine, but I need to have at least 4
instances (mail, irc, IM, actual terminal things) and sometimes that
grows to even larger numbers. So lightweightness is desirable.

-  I'm starting to switch to using jabber/XMPP for all of my IM needs.
The good news is that this attempt works *way* better than my
previous attempts. The AIM transport (which seems to be the de facto
IM standard in my network) works like a charm most of the time. I'm
not deleting pidgin for emergencies, but I'm pleased. The client that
I'm using, `mcabber <http://mcabber.com/>`__ works quite well. I'm
having two odd problems. First, I find that I'm having trouble adding
Google Gtalk users to my roster. It seems like it might be a DNS
glitch with dreamhost, but I can't get it nailed out. Secondly, I
seem to have done something so that I can *only* connect to my
account using mcabber, which isn't a problem in the short term, but
it could be annoying/deal breaking in the long term. At some point
I'll probably switch to running my own XMPP server (when I move off
of dreamhost) but in the mean time it would be nice to have this
fixed.

-  I'm thinking of switching away from Wordpress to a blogging platform
called `Jekyll <http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master>`__.
This tool would conform more to my workflow (easier posting), it
would be fun to have a blogging platform that I could conceptually
hack on myself. While I've been using Wordpress in its current
iteration for three or four years, I've used a lot of different CMSs
to power the TealArt/tychoish website. Greymatter (back in the day),
b2 (the predecessor for wordpress), and a custom CMS that a friend
wrote in 2001-2002. And I've toyed with Drupal and Moveable Type, of
course. While the current setup works--I think it's not entirely
ideal. I'll need to blog about this a bit more before. And the
conversion process promises to be somewhat complex. There's always
something interesting going on.

-  I'm thinking of using bootcamp and installing Linux on my macbook,
and going back to using that hardware more full time. It's good
hardware, I already have it, and it might be fun to use another
installation opportunity to play with Arch Linux (though I'll
probably wimp out and install ubuntu again). What I've discovered, I
think, is that while I have a lot of respect for and history with
Macs and OS X, a linux/awesome platform is--at the moment the system
that I feel most comfortable "living in," and most productive working
in.

Anyway, I'll get back to my day, and enjoy yours too. Remember today
means, 10.5 months without Christmas Music in public. That's something I
think we can *all* celebrate.
