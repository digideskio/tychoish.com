====================
Because Delany Rocks
====================

I have to admit--with some amount of shame--that I have such a library
of articles on my computer that I can basically write short little
papers of the kind that I have to this semester, based entirely on
articles I already have on my computer. This isn't to say that I'm not
reading new articles, just that I collect them, and don't read them
immediately.

Part of my paper today, on linguistic relativism, involved--as my
dearest friends will surely **not** be surprised--a brief reading of
Samuel Delany's science fiction novel *Babel-17,* which uses the
Saphir-Whorf Hypothesis to great effect.

So in doing so I did a search of my computer and found a great interview
with Delany that I downloaded, but didn't read, 3.5 years ago for a
paper I was writing on Delany then. I also, as happenstance, didn't read
the interview for another paper I was writing on Delany a year later.
Alas. Anyway, I found the following quote, which I think is priceless. I
hope you enjoy!

My life partner of nine years, Dennis, who, by his own admission has
read only a single book cover to cover (Cavel's *Shogun*, which he
picked entirely on the criterion of size: When, after he met me, he
decided he better read at least one, he figured he'd best make it a
big one), walked through the living room just this morning, as I was
talking on the phone with a long-time journalist friend, enthusing
over some structurally serendipitous discovery I'd made in a recent
reading of the incomplete draft of my current novel. Dennis gave a
wonderfully generous laugh and declared: "You guys are crazy . . .
!" before, with a grin, he left to meet a friend of his and go
walking in the Sunday morning street fair out on Broadway.
