============================
The Dangers of Consolidation
============================

I mentioned in an earlier post `that I thought Barnes and Noble was
largely responsible for the ongoing and impending collapse of the
publishing
industry <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/on-wanting-a-kindle/>`__, and
that's just the sort of thing that I couldn't leave a lone without a
little bit of further pondering.

The assertion is that Barnes and Nobel, and Borders particularly as they
competed for near total domination of the local-book retail market,
forced a consolidation of the publishing industry at the very moment
when the worst possible thing for publishing was consolidation.

Consolidation allows an operation to make a bunch of money quickly. The
mechanics of this are pretty simple, after all. When yo consolidate you
can cut all sorts of mundane expenses, from the physical costs of
maintaining parallel operations, to hard costs like printing and
shipping costs that can benefit from collective organization.

Amazon had a role in the consolidation of sale of books, certainly, but
Amazon has always been a *distribution* and *data* company, primarily.
Their strategy is to find a way to turn a profit on the sale of goods,
any goods: they do this by having a *complete inventory of everything*
and levering a lot of data concerning buying habits and browsing habits
to make sure people who are shopping find something to buy.

Where Amazon's limiting factor is connecting people who want to buy
things (books) with books they might like to buy, the "traditional" book
sellers, are limited by the amount of shelf space they can use to
display and promote books. So they edged all of the little booksellers
out of business by having huge stores and coffee shops and so forth, and
then faced with too many books and not enough shelf space, they used
their muscle to push the publishing industry toward increased
consolidation and a "blockbuster" business model.

Blockbusters are how the movie industry works. Production companies make
a bunch of movies, on the premise that if one or two turn a huge profit,
they can afford to make a number of movies that flop or that just
break-even. Hence the great power of reliable successes: another John
Grisham novel, Return of the Mummy King VI, etc., the "copy-cat"
phenomena and the erosion of the independent movie production business.

Book sellers were culpable as well--consolidation is attractive in what
are essentially commodity businesses--and selling easily produced
paper-based volumes is a commodity business. Maybe it would have
happened anyway, but the undeniable market success of Barnes and Nobel
is not, given what I can tell from where I'm sitting, a marker of
success of the publishing industry as a whole.

And you know, when you're a book seller, throwing the publishing
industry onto the tracks before an oncoming train, to achieve some
mildly impressive profits for a decade seems... not incredibly bright.
And not the kind of thing that I'm interested in supporting or putting
my faith in.

It strikes me that this "consolidation meme" is a common feature of
unsustainable and inauthentic economy, and it extends beyond book retail
into other failed and failing sectors of the ecomony.

- **Banks**. Obvious here. The big banks lost track of the micro
economics that make the macro economics go, and we got things like
sub-prime morgages, because while they make sense from the
consolidated-bank perspective they don't make sense to *people*.
Like, the John Grisham-esque Legal/Drama/Thriller book makes a lot of
sense to the booksellers and the publishers, but most people can only
really read so many of them before loosing interest.

- **Software**. Microsoft's production of windows makes a lot of sense
if you're a big company, but if you use computers in a specialized
way, Windows is like an illfitting suit from Target. It works, but
it's uncomfortable and rough around the edges. There is general
consensus that "The Microsoft Way" isn't the best technological
solution to the various problem, even among people who use it
regularly (developer tools might require a slightly more complex
investigation).

- **Your Example Here**. Leave a note in the comments.
