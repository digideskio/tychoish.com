Today's interview is with Angie Marshall. I think introductions here are
pretty much uncalled for, so here we go:

--------------

- **Who are you? What do you?**

  Angie Marshall, Legal Assistant is my paying job, but I am a Farm wife,
  mother of 3, a knitter, a former quilter and a half-assed gardener. I
  have multiple knitting projects OTN currently, but most consistently, I
  knit socks.

- **Merino or Blue Faced Leicester?**

  Either is awesome, but I will admit a fondness for Merino.

- **Lets talk about technology: What kind of technology do you use, and
  what's the coolest thing that technology enables for you? What about
  your technology do you find frustrating?**

  I use a palm centro for a phone, but alas, no interwebs connection from
  that. I like that it keeps my names/addresses/calendar at hand, but I am
  frustrated that i can't create I have an iPod touch that 98% of the time
  I use to listen to inspirational speeches or podcasts or audio books. I
  have music on it, but... *meh*. I have Scrabble and Soduko applications
  on it and I love them. This iPod frustrates me because I cheaped out on
  it and didn't get a big enough one so I am constantly juggling what gets
  put on it. I love my laptop, but wished the battery held more charge.

- Favorite book you've read in the last year? Runners up?

  Hanging my head in shame... the *Twilight* series. I listen to
  audiobooks mostly, but I did read those in real book form. I read for
  entertainment.

- **Favorite Websites?**

  `Ravelry <http://www.ravelry.com/>`__ and
  `Facebook <http://www.facebook.com/>`__.

- **What do you think was the most important event of the last 15
  years?**

  The election of our current President.

- **What do you think will be of the next 10?**

  I look forward to our scientific minds developing a fuel source that
  doesn't depend on foreign oil. I hope that we take the lessons learned
  from this last war and we return to a self-sufficiency mindset so that
  we never again make the mistake of sending our troups to war over oil. >

- **One thing that you're most looking forward to in the next year?**

  Getting better control of my life, cutting back to a 4 day work week
  (affirming, affirming), vacation, knitting camp, fresh asparagas morel
  mushrooms

- **One thing that you wish you could learn?**

  Spanish, there is such a need for spanish speakers in all areas of
  employment. My French from long ago High School, just isn't much help.

- **Cats vs. Dogs?**

  Cats in the house, Dogs outside. Nothing like a warm cat "spot" (or 2 or
  4) on a cold morning or a sick day.

- **Where can we find more about you/your projects?**

  `Knit4Angine <http://knit4angie.blogspot.com/>`__; `The Grumpy
  Farmer <http://the-grumpy-farmer.blogspot.com>`__ but I don't post much;
  perhaps this interview will goad me into posting a little more often.
