I wonder at what point I just gave up on my documents folder and started
a new /text folder. There's so much crap in documents that I never ever
touch, because it's irrelevant and old. Not throw away old, but old.

My ~/text folder is just the text files that I live in, and I have a
simple, everyone in a single folder with a folder for "archives," which
are things that I'm done with but that I want to keep around. Eventually
everything ends up on my DevonThink Pro Database and I'm a happy camper.
:)

I need to rethink this a bit, me thinks.
