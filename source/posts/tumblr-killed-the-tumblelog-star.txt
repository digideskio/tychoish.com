Tumblr Killed the Tumblelog Star

A few years ago, highly citational, link/youtube video blogs came back
into style *again.* This time rather than calling them blogs, we called
them "tumblelogs." I never really got into it, though I tried, and even
my original inspiration for starting
`tychoish.com <http://tychoish.com/>`__ was to do a more
"tumblelog-esque" blog.It never quite worked out. Then I read `this post
by Michael
Cot√© <http://www.redmonk.com/cote/2010/01/05/newwebwriting/>`__ which
inspired a few things:

First, it got the following title to stick in my head and refuse to get
out. Second, it left me with the idea that, although successful, sites
like `tumblr <http://www.tumblr.com/>`__ and to a different extent
`posterous <http://posterous.com/>`__ basically ruined the tumblelogging
revival.

Here's the thing about tumblelogs: they worked and worked so well
because they were efficient, because the people creating tumblogs were
doing something unique and had unique voices, because you could keep
your pulse on most of a single discourse by watching only a few
sites/rss feeds. And then it became, very suddenly, trivial to make a
tumble log. And so everyone had a tumblelog, and it was like blogging
was new again, except things "meme'd out" at an epic pace and it became
difficult to track what anyone was saying. It was like a distributed
denial of service attack on our attention spans.

And as the dust settled, tumblelogs, at least as far as I could see,
became less about a sort of delightful amalgamation of interesting
content and more about templates, about piping in a fire hose of content
from delicious/twitter/etc. So not only were there *too many*
tumblelogs, but the style had devolved somewhat into this weird
unedited, awkwardly template-ed mass of "crap" that is (in my opinion)
quite hard to read or derive value from.

What Made Tumblelogs Work Originally
------------------------------------

-  The systems that powered them were kludgy but they made it very
possible to post content easily. That's a good thing.

-  They used a unique sort of web design where design elements
(tables/grids/CSS magic,) reflected and accented the content type.

-  They were largely editorial functions. People followed tumblelogs
because their authors were able to filter though content with
exceptional speed and grace, and in the process of filtering provide
real value.

-  They were multimedia, and incorporated many different kinds of
content. Not just links, not just embedded youtube videos, but
snippets of IM and IRC conversations, song lyrics, pictures from
flickr, and so forth.

-  `projectionist <http://project.ioni.st/>`__ one of the first and
best, was a group effort: when group blogs work, they really work.
The tumblelog, seems like an ideal platform for group blogging.

How We Can Make Tumblelogs Work Again
-------------------------------------

-  We use publishing systems and tools that are unique and that stretch
and bend the form. A tumblelog theme for Wordpress, will probably
always reek like wordpress. Same with other popular content
management systems. Tumblelogs work because they're not just *blogs*,
they need to distinguish themselves both visually, and in terms of
how their authors write the content.

-  We undertake tumblogs as a collaborative effort. Group projects
complicate things, of course, but they also create great
possibilities.

-  Vary content, intentionally, post quotes, chat excerpts, links,
videos, lyrics, etc. Make sure that there's a great deal of diversity
of content. This is perhaps a problem to be solved in software, at
least in port.

-  Emphasize and cultivate editorial voice, and create an interface that
forces authors and editors to touch the data.

Thoughts? Suggestions?

**ETA:** I've started to work on `this wiki page outlining a "tumble
manager" tool <http://cyborginstitute.com/wiki/tumblemanager/>`__. I
also did a bit of textual refactoring on February 27, 2010
