what does research mean?

...so I stumbled upon a nifty website for SF writers and it started with
something morbidly funny, which I will reproduce here for your
amusement.

`she wants to lead a glamorous
life <http://cmpriest.livejournal.com/858138.html>`__:

"Hypothetically, being a writer-for-a-living means you never get a
day off. Ever. The deadlines don't typically move much, so it's
rather like having a permanent term paper due -- if you're lucky. If
you're not lucky, it's like not having any work due. And then you
starve to death.

But I digress."

(from `SF Novelists <http://www.sfnovelists.com>`__.)

...but then, near the end she talked about "research" as "pre-writing"
in a way that sounded a lot like what I would call "outlining." The
academic in me tends to understand "research" as "reading." Thus I think
of my writing research as broadly defined reading. But if I can get away
with calling outlining "research," I totally am.

So there.
