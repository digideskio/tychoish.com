I compleatly buy `this
argument <http://furbo.org/2007/07/16/multi-touch-on-the-desktop/>`__
about human/computer interaction, regarding UI and mutli-touch
interfaces ala the iPhone.

I have to say that ergonomics both on this, and a more specific level
(like keyboard layouts, and command line conventions) are of a great
interest to me.

I have to say though, that being able to do something more multi-touchy
with a track pad would be nice. We'll remember that we already have the
two finger scrolling, which I can't really live with out, so having an
additional command ability (like a second mouse click.)

Frankly though, the major coup of the iPhone is the pinch and zoom
thing, which makes a lot of sense on a very small screen, but
signifigantly less sense on your MacPro Cinema display, or MacBook.

Go figure.
