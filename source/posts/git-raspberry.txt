This is an awful pun, but I've recently written the following script to
help with some of the work of back-porting patch sets to maintenance
branches. Basically you pass it a bunch of commit identifiers and it
cherry picks them all in order.

::

#!/usr/bin/python

import os
import sys
import subprocess

for commit in sys.argv[1:]:
with open(os.devnull, "w") as fnull:
subprocess.call( ['git', 'cherry-pick', commit ], stdout=fnull, stderr=fnull )

What I'd been doing, previously is assembling commit hashes in an emacs
buffer, and then copy-pasting ``git cherry-pick`` before each line and
then pasting those lines into the shell and hoping nothing goes wrong.
The script isn't much better but it's a start.

To use, save in a file named ``git-raspberry`` in your ``$PATH``,
``chmod +x`` the file, and then just run "``git raspberry``\ ". Turns
out ``git`` runs any program in the path that starts with ``git-`` as a
sub command.

The more you know.
