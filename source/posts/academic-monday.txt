Good Monday to you all!

The period of time between thanksgiving and the second week of January
are designed to be a haze of sorts. Between the holiday morass that
seems to have enveloped America, the traditional end of semester crunch,
and my process of applying to graduate school, which is on going, it's
all ends up being a blur.

My goal for today is to make some headway on a paper that I think is due
wednesday (it's easy; a rant, that I've been working on for a while) and
of course, write my statement of purpose for graduate school
applications which needs to be good, so that I can send it out to a
professor. It's an important piece, and I think it's good that this
statement is so important, at the same time it's a hard document to
write, and there are a lot of things that I have to balance: Interested
and invested without looking jaded or to set in my ways, and I have to
be excited by my prospective advisors research and still look like an
individual, and so forth. Thankfully, my discipline isn't known for it's
fine and delicate rhetoric, so that's good, but it's tough.

So in that spirit, I'm going to post a couple of little doodling that I
came about over the last few days as I tried to think about getting a
statement t a statement together. Nothing good, yet, but cool ideas, and
half decent blog posts.

Seems like a good day to post them. So, enjoy!

Onward and Upward!
