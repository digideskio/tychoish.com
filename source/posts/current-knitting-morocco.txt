Current Knitting: Morocco

While I'll never be `WendyKnits <http://wendyknits.net/>`__, in terms of
up-to-datenss, or what not, I just took a picture of my current
knitting.

It's Joyce William's "Morocco" sweater from Lativan Dreams. I'm the
first person with a blog, that I can find, to be knitting it, though I
think that this is more in the realm of "uniqueness to the point of
obscurity," rather than "trendsetter" it's a start.

While I'm still knitting from the chart, it's gotten to be less
adventurous than it was at the beginning. I'm using `Old Mill Yarn,
"Domy Heather" <http://www.oldmillyarn.com/orderdavidson.htm>`__, which
I discovered at `camp <http://knittingcamp-2007.blogspot.com/>`__.

I'll keep you posted on it as it progresses.
