I've always been somewhat distraught by the fact that I'm, well down
right terrible at working in a wiki mode. Every so often I try and use
some wiki-based solution, often
`VoodooPad <http://www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/>`__, and it works
really well, until I realize that what I'm really doing is using it as
an inefficient file-system like binder. I just dump things in, one or
two layers deep and it often means that I just have a slightly more
complicated way of looking at my files. With some help from
`DevonTHINK <http://www.devon-technologies.com/>`__, I have a system
that works pretty well for me. [1]_

For `Station Keeping <http://tychoish.com/hanm/>`__ I'm trying to keep
some sort of documentation, which contains a lot of unreleased and
brainstorming material that's helpful (and necessary) to maintain for
the group of writers. Problem is that I don't think in a wiki sort of
way. Which means that this document is a pain in the rear to navigate,
and given the way I want the software to work: a pain in the rear to
code. I've tried
`PMWiki <http://www.pmichaud.com/wiki/PmWiki/PmWiki>`__, and most
recently `Plain Text
Wiki <http://interconnected.org/home/2007/05/20/plain_text_wiki>`__, and
really neither of these solutions really work for what I'm doing.

Ultimately this returns to a theme that I've been struggling from the
`very beginning of
TealArt <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/perfect-notebook-bliss/>`__, back
in 2002, where I talked about my struggle for good notebooks. With
Moleskine's these days, I've basically found the analog solution, but I
need something that will work digitally, particularly for the *Station
Keeping* documentation, but for my day to day purposes as well.

I suppose to get the conclusion that I've come to you need to first know
how my paper notebooks are laid out and my method of finding things.
Basically I start a new page for each new chunk: each list, outline,
note, and set of directions and so forth. I usually write some sort of
identifying title at the top for what's contained inside, which I
underline. Because it's paper, and it's all bound together, and I have a
pretty good contextual memory for the associations between what I write
and when I write it, so the chronological aspect helps a lot.

What does this sound like? Yeah, I know: a weblog [2]_. Why didn't
someone pass me this memo earlier, it would have been helpful. What does
this mean? Time to set up additional blogs to take care of these needs,
because clearly thats what by brain seems to need/want. Maybe some of it
will be interesting to you, but somehow I doubt this.

I must admit that I haven't been using DThink as much recently as I
might like to, because I have a slight organizational crisis now that
I'm (seasonally) not in school any more. My database is perhaps not
laid out optimally, but I still really like it. If
`EagleFiler <http://c-command.com/eaglefiler/>`__ were just a little
bit better, I think that I could have a mash-up that would be ideal,
while I wait for DT 2.0, which is perhaps the real reason that I'm
not reorganizing my database. There's a reason that I have these
footnotes. To talk to myself. *Sigh*

Is it true that academics are the only ones that call them "weblogs"
any more? Is it a sign of my not getting it or a sign of my
old-timmer cred? I don't really want to know.
