iphone possibilities

New information about the ipod is just coming out from apple. While I'm
(clearly) not going to get one, and I'm sort of passe about the whole
deal I want to talk about the plans/possibilities of this device. First,
`the relevant press release from
apple <http://www.apple.com/iphone/pr/20070626plans.html>`__.

Basically, 60 bucks for 450 minutes (5000 rather than unlimited off peak
mins) and 200 text messages, 80 bucks for twice as many peak minutes and
unlimited night times.

For unlimited data that you'd presumably be able to share with your
laptop via bluetooth that's not a bad idea. I wonder a few things: why
would people use SMS if you have email included for free? Also, why are
they hoping to make on the 5000 vs. unlimited weekend minutes.

I think I'm firmly in the "wait for rev 2," which will presumably have
faster internet. But frankly if they make an ipod tablet (ie. iphone
without the phone,) I'm *so there*...
