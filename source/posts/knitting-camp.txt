I just got into `School House Press' Knitting
Camp <http://www.schoolhousepress.com/>`__, and my roommate is going to
be someone amazingly `awesome <http://trickytricot.typepad.com/>`__.

I'm so unbelievably excited. I think if I were to be talking I'd be
reduced to squeaks. I have class in 15 minutes, this is going to be
interesting.

I'll get back to you all with more regular blogging very soon. Tuesdays
are for Knitting essays after all.
