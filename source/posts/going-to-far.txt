...because when you can't make fun of your friends, you're relegated to
making fun of 20 year old interview tapes. Imagine the follwoing:

Subject: [gives long rambling, but interesting answer to question]

Interviewer: [Could you condense the story and cut out these tangents?]
Ok, [asks question again.]

Subject: I was looking for community.

[PAUSE]

Interviewer: Um. [PAUSE] If you could start with [begining of story.]

Subject: You want it all over again but compressed? Okay. Ah, well, ah,
um... [PAUSE] let's, ah [PAUSE] ask me the question again?
