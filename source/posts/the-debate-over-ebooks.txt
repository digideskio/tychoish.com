I read something a few weeks ago (the problem with being slow to process
things from blogs that post regularly), `about digital ebook readers and
the future of digital
books <http://futurismic.com/2009/03/11/progress-the-ebooks-debate-rumbles-on/>`__.

I guess my thoughts are best summed up in a couple of points, basically
that electronic texts will succeed as they: develop unique and
presentation methods (hardware and software), and as the
commerce/distribution models become more transparent.

1. Words on screens don't work like words on paper. They just don't, and
we need to develop new ways of reading/writing that engage the medium
better. We got prose out of the transition to bound-books, novels out
of printing press (loosely;) the success of ebooks, I think will
require some sort of new way of writing/reading/interacting with
text, and no ebook implementation has gone there.

2. The potential for profit of digital goods is immense:
distribution/production costs are much lower than their material
counterparts, because printing, delivery, etc. aren't factors for
digital things. There is, however, value and work that goes into
publishing texts, and we need some way of supporting creators. I'm
not sure that the existing publishing/content industry's models make
a good example to follow, and "micropayments" (the stock alternate
response) don't seem to really work. I tend to think that fellowships
funded by a subscription model/tax on connectivity is more the way to
go. But that's me.
