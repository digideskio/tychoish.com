The Old Projects Project

Before a road trip a, by now, a couple of months ago, I installed a copy
of `nginx <http://www.nginx.org>`__ on my laptop on the hope of doing
some web development and working on other projects when I was in the
car. For the uninitiated (you mean you don't *all* write technical
documentation for web developers and systems administrators?!?) nginx is
an incredibly powerful web server. As of June 11th, ``foucualt`` the
server that hosts the `Cyborg
Institute <http://www.cyborginstitute.com>`__ and
`tychoish <http://tychoish.com>`__.

This is, almost always, I think, a loosing proposition.

I never get any sort of substantial (or insubstantial) work done during
my road trips up-and-down the north east corridor. Not that that's a bad
thing, but I also expect that there'll be more awake-time when I'm not
driving or gossiping.

And there never is.

So the web server sat unused for a long time on my laptop, but recently
I've been playing with it a bit and I've finally gotten a number of cool
things set up. I have a local "git web" instance which makes it easier
to track progress on local and private projects that are stored in git.
Perhaps more importantly, I have set up quick local
`ikiwiki <http://ikiwiki.info/>`__ instances for a number of projects.
They're easy to configure, quick to setup, and while I suppose I could
hack something together in nifty for myself, there's something nifty
about being able to take an alternate view of some content and also
being able to *really* preview changes to you work before publishing
them.

Also, and the real reason for this post, is that by virtue of this
development, I have revisited a few projects that had been lingering in
the home directory of my computer for *far too long*. Which has been a
powerful and useful exercise.

By which I mean, it's been painful.

Besides "the novel," which has been the lingering and dragging front
burner project for a year, there are a number of quasi-serial stories
that have lingered in some state of incompleteness for a couple of years
now. I'm kind of amazed both at how foreign these stories seem to me
both in terms of the style (good to know that I'm a better writer than I
was a few years ago,) and also how quickly I can fall right back into
the story and tell you every little thing about the world, situation,
and moment where I left off.

The mind is, indeed, an amazing thing.

Where my strategy for the past year has been to "plow through and finish
the novel," I think my tactic this summer will be to move all of my
projects forward in some way. Small daily writing goals for the novel,
combined with somewhat less regular (but more specific) goals with
regards to other projects. In the next two months I want to have a
fairly active and varied writing schedule worked out that isn't based
around the monthly (or so) weekend binges that I've been using for most
of the last year.

That's the plan at any rate.
