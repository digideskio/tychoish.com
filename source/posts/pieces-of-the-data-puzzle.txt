Pieces of the Data Puzzle
=========================

I'd like to talk a bit about what I've come up with in terms of data
management/research organizational tools. So in my `last post on this
subject <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/data-management/>`__ I mentioned
that I had hacked together a shell script that did a lot of what I
needed. Rather than look for the "one right" OS X tool (which I don't
think really exists at this point,) I've worked on collecting extant
tools and programs and figuring some way of making something that would
really continue to work into the future and that would be more tailored
to my particular workflow.

I'm going to outline and present what I'm doing for the public
betterment anyone else looking for something like this. Also I hope that
people with a similar sort of need/workflow might be able to contribute
tools or offer enhancements.

Let me outline the pieces of the puzzle, first:

- OS X/UNIX shell. [1]_ Having access to all of these great unix tools
  makes it reasonably easy to write scripts to automate the key parts
  of this workflow. Also, as most of my system reilies on Apache (which
  comes installed on OS X) and web servers, having this kind of low
  level access to the system is great.

- `ikiwiki <http://www.ikiwiki.info/>`__. So this is a great little
  program that takes a directory of text files, and turns them into a
  wiki/website via a `markdown <http://daringfireball.com/markdown/>`__
  interpreter. It also connects and automates through subversion, an
  open source version management tool (it can also use git and others
  if that's more your speed.) This part of the project is probably *the
  geekiest* and most difficult part to get working, particularly if you
  don't have access a good package installer. But it's possible and
  totally worth it.

- Several bash/shell scripts that I have written to insert data and
  clips into the wiki.

  - One script that, with a command in the form of,
    ``clip [FileName] [Space delinated tags]`` will create a page in a
    research clipping section of the wiki with the contents of the
    clipboard, and the proper notation for tag organization and the
    date of collection. The script then opens the file in the text
    editor. I wish it could capture, more automatically the citation
    information (author/url) but I think this would require the
    browser to expose more information than it currently does. But
    it's pretty good.

  - One script that create new "tag indexes," which makes it easier to
    see all the pages tagged with specific labels. If I were more
    clever I could probably tie the scripts together so that whenever
    I added a new tag that didn't already exist that it would generate
    the new tag page. Except that this wouldn't cover all instances of
    new tag pages, so it's ok to have separate tag pages. This also
    helps control "tag sprawl," and prevent metadata from getting out
    of control.

- A set very quick functions that let me append text any text file, as
  well as a quick command to append lines to the end of a general
  "inbox" or "codex.txt" file for quick thoughts, notes, todos, and
  tasks. This is outside of the wiki and not a new tool, but it works.

- `Fluid <http://www.fluidapp.com>`__ - This is a really nifty program
  that uses OS X tools to build "programs" built around single, site
  specific websites. Basically this is the ideal bridge between "web
  apps" and "desktop apps," particularly once `Google
  Gears <http://gears.google.com/>`__ begins to work with this kind of
  app [2]_ amazing things are going to happen. Since I'm running the
  wiki locally, this is moot. There are other non-mac options like
  `Mozilla Prisim <http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Prism>`__,
  though I don't have experience with it. This makes the wiki more
  useable and open I think.

`Here's a
file <http://tychoish.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/research_sh.zip>`__
with the relevant scripts and ikiwiki templates that I'm using. It's
rough and kludgy, but if people are interested or willing to contribute
(feedback, knowhow, etc.), I'd certainly be willing to work on making
this more polished and accessible.

**ETA:** I just discovered `bsag's textmate
plugin <http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/journal-textmate-plugin/>`__,
which might be a little more prime-time ready than my script, but I
think with ikiwiki's tagging function and potentially a recourse to
spotlight/etc indexing, my solution works better for me. But,
`bsag <http://www.rousette.org.uk/>`__ is awesome and the text mate
bundle is totally way more hard core than my kludge.

.. [1] If you use a windows machine, or don't have easy access to a shell,
   my recommendation is that rather than fight windows to try and get
   all these things installed and working, I would see about getting
   server space somewhere where you'd get hosting that would include
   shell/ssh access in a UNIX environment. Probably the cost is pretty
   low, and you could use an account like this to back up data, host
   your email, and so forth.

.. [2] I've written here before a couple of times about how much I really
   dislike the experience of using online/web applications. Programs
   like this really solve this complaint. My major complaint is still
   the fact that there aren't good offline options for web apps, which
   is why I mention Gears. This is mooted by the fact that in this
   instance we're/I'm running the server locally, so even without a
   connection the wiki is accessible.
