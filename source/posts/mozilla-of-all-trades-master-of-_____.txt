In my `post about calendar
programs <http://tychoish.com/posts/calendar-ing/>`__ a number of
`great <http://www.thelinuxblog.com/>`__
`readers <http://ciarang.com/>`__ suggested that I should try
"Lightning" or "Sunbird" which are part of the `Mozilla Calendar
Project <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/>`__. Calendars from
the people who bring us Firefox and Thunderbird.

I didn't include these programs in my initial review for a couple of
reasons. The first, is that I downloaded an early beta of Sunbird, and
was (unsurprisingly) rough, and I didn't see that there was anything
particularly earth-shattering. The second is that I find the Mozilla
applications to be remarkably awkward and borderline unusable.

So I've begun to to download and test Sunbird, in an attempt to be
complete and because I suspect that the quality of the application has
improved in the past couple of years. I don't use Thunderbird because of
my aversion to Mozilla and XUL (and `mutt sucks
less <http://www.mutt.org/>`__), which nixed the lightening option.

And now on to the interesting part, why I hate Mozilla apps. They all
suck. Which is to say that they all look the same, and have this
shrink-wrap feel that feels awkward in almost every operating
system/environment. This means that everything looks ugly and
functionality is never where you'd expect it to be. This might be a good
thing if you use a bunch of different operating systems, and want your
apps to be consistent cross-platform, but generally I think this is
heavy handed and it means that your "cross platform" apps don't work
like any of the other "platform apps."

Now of course web browsers and email clients are pretty straightforward
and there isn't a lot learning curve, but I think usability and
ergonomics in contemporary desktop computing comes down to seconds of
frustration and confusion, and not upfront learning curves. At least for
me.

To be fair I use Firefox without complaint on my linux environments and
I think they work great for that, and I think the real test of Sunbird
will be how well the experience is on a linux system. I'm not sure if
this is a product of the fact that everything seems a little disjointed
about user interface on linux. In this direction I find it particularly
annoying that Mozilla apps don't work with the "Services" menu on OS X.

I've found this annoyance factor with any Mozilla product I've used in
recent years. I've always blamed it on XUL (the Mozilla interface design
methodology), and the idea that Mozilla seems to place a greater
emphasis quantity of users than specific quality. Am I the only one who
feels this way? Do other people really like the Mozilla apps' user
interface? Why?/Why not?

Cheers!
