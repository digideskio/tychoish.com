`Alex wrote this article about "everything
buckets" <http://www.al3x.net/2009/01/31/against-everything-buckets.html>`__
that got me thinking. And you know how dangerous this can be.

I've been thinking about "everything buckets," as "information buckets,"
and I think this term is a little more apt, given how these systems
work. Basically the "everything" bucket, is a program that provides a
database interface on top of our files in the effort of keeping us
better organized. Features common to the information bucket, genre of
programs are meta data and tagging interfaces, easier/integrated editing
environments, more advanced search abilities, and easier input features.
All wrapped up in one nifty package.

Alex's article makes a rather important critique of these programs, and
one with which I mostly agree. He argues that the "buckets" themselves
are non-free/closed source (bad for your data,) and that they abstract
the organizational problems of organizing files rather than actually
resolve those problems. Alex suggests that the best way to deal with
this is to give up learn how to organize files on the file system itself
and use better tools to store data.

Pragmatically I agree with him: I use structured formats to store most
of my data, and have a simple but effective means for storing my data.
It works, and I'm sure if you spend enough time talking about
information management stuff with me, you'll hear more than you ever
wanted to know about how I store and use information.

But the "information bucket" approach has a lot going in it's favor, and
*my approach* isn't a really broad solution. Here's what's good about
this approach:

1. If you store your data in *one bucket* then there's only one place
that your data could be, which makes it much easier to find any given
thing when you're trying to look for something that you just *know*
you saved *somewhere*.

2. If we're left to our own devices to develop structured data a couple
of things happen. First is that we don't give it enough structure, so
we end up with a few hundred files in a directory and no good way to
make heads or tails of them. Then, to compensate for this, we create
folders has a way of bookmarking specific bits of data, and end up
with (potentially) too much structure that doesn't convey productive
information.

I agree that the OS X information bucket isn't an ideal solution to this
problem, but I think there is a substantive problem here that need some
sort of unified solution. I'm not sure what that unified solution is, or
even if there's going to be a one-size-fits-all response for all users.
But I think it's a question that we need to begin to think about.
