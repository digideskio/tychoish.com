Buildcloth Release, No. 1
=========================

Today I released the first version of
`Buildcloth <http://cyborginstitute.org/projects/buildcloth/>`__ which
is a tool that I've been using at work to programatically (and in some
cases) dynamically generate build systems (i.e. Makefiles.)

Background
----------

It's obviously been "production ready" in some sense for a while, but I
recently finished the API documentation, and a lot of the infrastructure
for packaging and distribution, so it seemed like this was a good
starting point.

The initial idea was basically that while Make syntax can be really
powerful, in a number of situations:

- to specify conditional elements,

- to generate build targets and procedures based on system
configuration or project state,

- for large numbers similar of targets, and

- for build with where single targets have a group of related rules,

defining build systems programatically ends up producing a much more
reliable and maintainable build system. The wins are pretty big in terms
of maintainability, clarity, and flexibility.

The idea, and naming, is sort of: do what
`fabric <http://fabfile.org/>`__ does for shell scripts and deployment
but for build system generators. Maybe this is exactly what you're
looking for.

More Information
----------------

Check it out:

- `buildcloth on Pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/buildcloth/>`__
- `buildcloth github repo <https://github.com/tychoish/buildcloth>`__

`Bugs go
here <https://issues.cyborginstitute.net/buglist.cgi?cmdtype=runnamed&namedcmd=buildcloth>`__,
and patches/pull requests are always welcome.

Cool Improvements:
------------------

- full documentation.

- support for specifying targets/dependencies as a list.

- a build-rule abstraction called RuleCloth.

- improved ninja support.

The Roadmap
-----------

- making the tutorial and high level documentation better.
- improving the "RuleCloth."
- adding some preliminary tools for managing data interactions.
- pypy support (why not?)
