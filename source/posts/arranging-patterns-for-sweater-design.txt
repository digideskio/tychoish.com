Arranging Patterns for Sweater Design
=====================================

There are two major problems in sweater making (design.) First, figure
out how to make the shape you want out of knitting, and second to
place some sort of ornamental feature (pattern) in the knitting
without disrupting the shape.

Shaping isn't easy, but it's solvable. Once you figure out how to make
the shapes you want, it's just a matter of implementing a known
process. Shaping becomes trivial.

The second problem, the design, is the really clever part.

Fitting patterns and embellishments onto a shape, just isn't solvable,
and never becomes trivial. There are tricks, and practices makes it
easier, but the possibilities are truly endless and there's no
reason to make any two sweaters exactly the same. [#exception]_

The patterns and embellishments can be pretty broadly defined: cables,
colorowork, other texture patterns, and so forth.

In my own knitting, I have taken to focusing almost entirely on the
second problem. I have a basic sweater form that works really well for
me, and each sweater explores a different combination of patterns.

My approach is as follows:

- Divide the sweater into quadrants and plan a single quadrant of the
  sweater. Repeat this pattern over the entire sweater. This
  automatically centers the pattern on the sweater.

- Be flexible with the number of stitches but not too flexible. Also
  remember to account for a "middle" and "end" stitch which may not be
  repeated on every quarter.

- Think of birds eye view of the design. This means thinking about
  sweater design as a collection of pattern columns.

- Use patterns at either side of the sweater both for a nice effect
  *and* to "bound" the patterns. This can be helpful in controlling the
  number of stitches.

- Unless you plan to knit your sweater horizontally, plan your sweater
  virtually even if you have horizontal patterns. It's crucial to
  center patterns that run horizontally across the sweater. Thinking
  vertically is the easiest way to do this visually for all kinds of
  patterns.

  If you're using only one pattern that's fewer than 10-15 stitches,
  you may be able to just make sure that your pattern divides in the
  total number of stitches in the sweater, but that's a much less
  common problem.

Beyond that, it's all trial, error, and practice. Onward and Upward!
