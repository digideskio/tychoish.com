So while I'm a bit (ha!) of a tea junkie, I must confess that my tea
brewing/tea pot equipment is pretty minimal. I have (had) a couple of
tea pots that were obtained at church rummage sales, and I bought a
small pot for afternoon/testing purposes recently, but other than that:
not so much. I recently discovered that my standard pot which is a great
stonewear ceramic beast has a defect in the (internal) glaze which I
think means that it's ready for retirement.

Former roommates will remember my general disregard for cleaning tea
cups and the like, on the general theory, that a rinse + hot water +
acidic tea is really all the cleaning one needs. I, however draw the
line at "cracked glaze and exposed porous stonewear." I have another
pot, but it was a whim rummage sale purchase, and it has a wire handle
(hard to hold,) a small opening (hard to rinse) and it dribbles
effusively. This basically means the only tea pot I have at the moment
is an old glass one. Which would be nice, except it looses heat at a
truly astounding rate. Tip: glass tea pots not good.

There are a few things that are different about my tea making habits now
as opposed to previous eras. First, I use loose leaf and strain either
with a hand strainer, preferably some sort of tea pot infuser, or a hand
made tea bag. I also, rarely brew individual cups any more. So I think
my needs are a bit different than they once were. So new tea pot, here I
come.
