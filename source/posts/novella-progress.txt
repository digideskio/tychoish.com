Novella Progress

A blog about writing. I just wanted to catalogue some accomplishments
and statistics about my fiction writing project).

My Novella project, (working title: *Knowing Mars*, I suppose now it's
big enough to be called by it's name, without worry about jinxing it,)
has reached the 10k word mark, with three chapters completed. Based on
my outline, which through no fault of my own I'm sticking to pretty
well, I'm at the one-thrid mark.

Chapters take between 7 and 12 days to finish, basically two or two and
a half weeks depending on how my writing time works out.

I think I'm going to send this chunk on to a couple of first readers
while I outline chapter 4 in depth and work on a short story, for some
change.
