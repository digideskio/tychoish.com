In lieu of having anything particularly useful to say about technology,
I'm going to write a version of an entry that I write every now and then
that goes over the application and work flows that I use in my day to
day computer life. These things change, a bit every now and then, and I
think it's interesting to keep track of these things. As always all
these programs run on OS X 10.4 (tiger), and my 15 inch PowerBook G4,
Zoe which I cary around with me almost all the time.

1. `NetNewsWire <http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/>`__

   This is the worlds best `RSS
   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)>`__/feed/news
   reader and I'm quite pleased with it generally. Because of NNW most
   of my reading of the internet these days is via RSS, and NNW is the
   program to use, and so I can't speak too highly of it, at the same
   time, I feel as if the program hasn't had many very good
   developments in a really long time. Having said that, it's *really*
   stable. Because I'm so invested, I have a list of subscriptions
   that numbers about 500. I could probably tone this down a bit, and
   not all of them are active, but still, it would be hard to
   transition to any other program given the way that my reading habit
   is so centrally focused on NNW, so while I might like some other
   features of the program, I don't really think that I can move away
   from it. I would still recommend it though.  Good stuff.

2. `DevonTHINK <http://www.devon-technologies.com/>`__

   This is totally the mother of all applications. It's a persona
   database tool, and any description of the program really doesn't do
   it justice, and there are so many different ways to use the program
   which further complicates it. I use the program, basically, as a
   notebook/folder for all the things I write, all the scholarly
   articles that I read, and clippings from websites.  The program has
   "AI" features which help you organize and find things when you need
   to, and it's really splendid. It also works as an outliner, and it
   has great import/export features. I tend to use the program as the
   storage bin for all the textual things that I deal with day to day,
   and it works great. I sometimes feel as if I'm not doing enough
   with this program, but it's nice to know that it'll grow with me.

3. `WriteRoom <http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/product/writeroom>`__

   This program has become a key part of my workflow. I tend to write
   many of my drafts (like for this very article) in WR and then save
   it elsewhere. It's just a plain text editor, but it works full
   screen, so I have it set up to print fairly big green text on a
   black background in a font that I'm comfortable drafting in, so I
   can work distraction free (also there's a hotspot on the screen
   which lets you check the word count, which I find helpful), and I
   find that this has really helped my writing productivity.

4. `Quicksilver <http://quiksilver.blacktree.com/>`__

   This is *the* killer app, and I think that I've written `enough
   <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/whining-about-command-lines/>`__ about
   it here already. I use QS to do everything from updating my
   `twitter <http://www.twitter.com/tychoish/>`__, to organizing my
   files, to appending text files, to powering a host of quick
   "trigger" commands (combinations of keys that are asigned various
   specified commands), oh yeah, it's a program launcher. QS ties
   everything together and it's awesome.

5. `TextMate <http://macromates.com/>`__

   This is sort of the power-editor program. I use it more for editing
   than for drafting, but it's a very powerful program without being
   bloated and overdone. It has "packages" for Markdown,
   Multi-Markdown, Blogging, HTML, PHP, and just about any other
   programing/markup language you could think of. I use it for posting
   to TealArt, I use it for maintaining my todo list, for preparing
   files, and most of the day-to-day editing in my workflow. This is
   the program (along with `DevonThink
   <http://www.devon-technologies.com/>`__) that has allowed me to
   finally start working in text files/markdown.  Because of this I
   have a working "text" folder that contains a bunch of text files,
   it's good stuff.

6. `Adium <http://www.adiumx.com/>`__/`Colloquy <http://colloquy.info/>`__

   These are the basic chat programs. I don't kid when I say that AIM
   is basically my cell phone. It's how I keep in touch and contact
   folk. It's almost always open, and having Adium lets me maintain
   connections to all the major (and some minor) networks, without
   having to think about it. Colloquy isn't quite `mIRC
   <http://www.mirc.com/>`__, but it's a great program, it does
   everything that you could want, and I like being able to be on IRC
   again. That's what internet community is all about, and I'm a big
   fan.

7. Mail.app

   Most of my email these days is handled through `Gmail
   <http://gmail.google.com/>`__ anyway, but since I always have my
   computer with me, and I'm more likely to have my computer, but not
   have internet access, than I am to have my computer but not have
   internet access.

8. `Camino <http://www.caminobrowser.org/>`__

   This has become my web-browser of choice. I like having a browser
   that works with the OS X service Menu and other OS specific
   features (`firefox <http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/>`__
   doesn't), but I've always felt that Safari was a bit *off*, and
   Camino does a fine job at being spot-on and still working with
   OS. As you can probably tell from this list, I'm a big fan of mac-y
   programs, that have really tight integration features, hence the
   browser choice.

9. `VLC <http://www.videolan.org/vlc/>`__

   It's the video player that plays anything and everything. It's
   reliable, and on top of that, it has the best software
   amplification of any app. This is a must-have free APP, and it
   really does play anything.

10. `Pukka <http://codesorcery.net/pukka>`__

    Pukka is just a little app that makes it easy to post to
    `del.icio.us <http://del.icio.us/>`__, which I don't do nearly
    enough. I tried using another open source app to do the same
    thing, but I've found that Pukka is just a hair faster and it has
    a smaller visual footprint. The other program also ate several
    weeks of bookmarks a few times, and I haven't forgiven it yet.

11. Think

    This is a new program that I think I will be using more in the
    future, although it won't replace WriteRoom. Basically this
    program puts a screen behind the program that you're currently
    using and all your other open windows to make it easier to
    concentrate on the task at hand. It's great because it deadens all
    the other programs so that they aren't as distracting or you can't
    click on them as easily, but you can still see them a little so
    you don't feel "out of touch"

12. `Growl <http://growl.info/>`__

    This is the master of all program distraction. Growl is a unified
    system notification pathway that all sorts of applications can
    pass messages to that float on top what ever you're doing to let
    you know whats going on. You can change the style duration and
    type of the notifications that growl takes. I get notifications
    when I get a new email, when someone sends me an instant message,
    when something changes in an IRC channel, and when there's a new
    post to twitter, among other things. You'd think that this would
    be really distracting, and while it was for a few days, I've found
    that knowing that I'll get a notification (even/especially one
    that I tend to ignore/miss) means that I don't check for
    email/IM/instant messages/etc. as compulsively or as often, so in
    a weird way this particular distraction means that I'm a bit more
    productive. A lot of "mac" programs use growl notifications, and
    it's really a great little "feature."

Ok, Folks, I fear that I may have blathered on to long. If you use
another program that I've missed, or have any questions please leave a
comment or send a message. I'm always looking for more and better
programs.

cheers, tycho
