I hate computer mice. A lot.

The closest I've gotten to liking a pointing device is an acquiescence
to the TrackPoint on the laptops I use. That's the little red dot in the
middle of the ThinkPad keyboards. My problem with computer mice is the
context switch between "typing-mode" and "mousing-mode." Moving between
the modes is jarring and inefficient. I've been using
`StumpWM <http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm>`__ and other similar window
managers for years now and as my need for the mouse decreases my
irritation with needing to use a mouse increases.

I've been struggling for a few months with a bit of a problem: Several
months ago I got a new bigger ThinkPad, a T510, while it has my beloved
TrackPoint there is also a TouchPad. After years of only using laptops
with the red dot, this was very disconcerting. How did I keep from
triggering the touchpad with my wrists? Couldn't I just turn the damn
thing off?

I did, and everyone who tried to use the computer after that was
dismayed, and I didn't care. Except, I found out that, apparently,
disabling the touchpad also disables all non-TrackPoint pointers. So
when I plugged the laptop into the docking station, the external mouse
didn't work.

Blast.

The solution to disabling and enabling the mouse on the fly, that
follows isn't as pretty as I'd like, but it works.

**UPDATE**: Turns out that my original procedure only *appears* to work.
I've made the following modification to the ``toggle-mouse`` script,
*using a stock xorg.conf* file.

**File:** */usr/bin/toggle-mouse*

::

#!/bin/sh

TOUCHPAD=`xinput list | egrep "TouchPad" | sed -r 's/.*id=([0-9]*).*$/\1/'`

if [ `xinput list-props "$TOUCHPAD" | egrep -o "[0-9]$" | head -n1` -eq 0 ]; then
xinput set-prop "$TOUCHPAD" "Device Enabled" 1
elif [ `xinput list-props "$TOUCHPAD" | egrep -o "[0-9]$" | head -n1` -eq 1 ]; then
xinput set-prop "$TOUCHPAD" "Device Enabled" 0
else
xmpp-notify "Your mouse is probably screwed up somehow"
fi

Test the output of
"``xinput list | egrep "TouchPad" | sed -r 's/.*id=([0-9]*).*$/\1/'``\ ",
and inspect "``xinput list``\ " to make sure that the value of
``$TOUCHPAD`` is the xorg ``id`` of the touchpad (or other device) that
you want to disable.

I'd actually recommend *not* putting this in ``/usr/bin/``, but just so
long as it's in the path. Then run ``toggle-mouse`` at the command line.
You may need to run this as root-suid, for your system system is
configured. Tweak the ``TOUCHPAD`` variable as needed.

[[If you have a better solution, I would be terribly interested in
hearing about it\|discourse]].
