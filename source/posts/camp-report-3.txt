1. `Franklin <http://the-panopticon.blogspot.com/>`__ tried on my
`tychoish henry viii <http://tychoish.com/posts/sirmr-henry/>`__
sweater.

- I need to take such better pictures of my knitting.

2. I did pretty well in the contest, I got some hemp/wool yarn. The
shawl I raffled off to support camp scholarships, did pretty well,
and it went to Carol Anderson of `Cottage
Creations <http://www.iseespots.com/store/c-40-cottage-creations.aspx>`__
who is a great deal of fun.
3. There were great dirty jokes at the end of class. I think someone
needs to introduce a skit night.
4. I've actually gotten some knitting done, and no longer feel so
hopeless about my project and my knitting. So I think, I'm back.
5. I should expound upon this further in the coming weeks, but I'm still
thinking about the various merits of knitting work and not knitting
work.
6. I bought long inox knitting needles. There will be gansey knitting.

That's all for now. I have a long drive tomorrow, so there might be
something that jott will transcribe for me at the end of the day, but
regular posting will resume after that.

Oh, and I have a lot of knitting to do between now and then.
