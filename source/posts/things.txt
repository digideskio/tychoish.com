- I plyed a ball of spindled yarn. 7 more grams. No clue on yardage.

- I'm eight rounds away from being half way done with the bulk (but
  not all) of this sleeve. In reality, this means that the sleeve is
  like 8 inches long, but saying it in other ways is less depressing.

- I have been asked to do an essoteric folk music show on `KDHX
  <http://www.kdhx.org/>`__ this Saturday for an hour. This is kind of
  funny in an annoying sort of way.

- I blocked the sweater that I've been whining about for a long time.
  The blocking fixes most of my concerns and I think about 10 minutes
  with a steam iron and I can fix the remaining concern. (I paid too
  much attention to the shoulders and the sleeves aren't right as a
  result.) But it's good. The code name for this sweater on the blog
  is "Turkish Tile."

- I suspect that my fate at one of my schools is being decided as I
  write this, and I should have formal news by Wednesday I suspect.
  Eek. I'm of distracted mindset as a result of this, but because I'm
  so helpless to do anything, its all very "free floating." There's a
  reason I'm not really trying to write a coherent post this morning.

- I'm slowly easing my way back into the `ravelry
  <http://www.ravlery.com>`__ community, because've been absent from
  those forums for a while. That's nice.

- I have errands to do this morning:

  - get a zipper

  - get copies of keys made

- I'm going to go dancing tonight, third night in a row. Oy. I really
  like dance, lets not get this confused, but as a social outlet, it
  sucks (particularly for someone my age, particularly when people are
  stupid), and while the activity rocks it's all centered around
  social interaction. Now, to be fair, Morris dance is better than
  other things (under some conditions, and yesterday was great), but,
  wow.  I'm not really complaining, just, balking at the absurdity,
  really.

- I've been watching Enterprise, still, I think I have eight episodes
  left.

- I can't decide if it's really bad or if it's using irony
  effectively.  Like, there was an episode arc with Orion "Slave
  Girls," which tied into an original series episode that was
  basically an excuse to have almost naked women painted green. This
  episode wasn't *much* different, though we learn at the end that the
  Orion "Slave Girls" were basically commandos, and that they were "in
  charge" of the Orion culture. Which, I'll accept as a good faith
  effort on the part of the writers to right a trek-wrong, even if it
  was sort of poorly handled, and felt like an afterthought. To a
  large extent, the same thing goes for the Mirror Universe stuff (a
  woman ends up in power at the end of the arc, despite the fact that
  the whole arc feels like an excuse to see the actress'
  mid-sections), though I would say that all of the previous interest
  in Mirror Universe stuff comes from seeing "our" characters interact
  with their "evil" counterparts, and that's basically missing from
  enterprise.

- I think my next television series watching project is going to be
  something more interesting. I have "tales of the city" DVDs to
  watch, and that's next. After that, *shrug*.
