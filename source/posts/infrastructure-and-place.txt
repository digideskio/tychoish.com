Infrastructure and Place
========================


I've been playing around with writing a story or a few stories about
transpiration infrastructure,

I spend a lot of time on trains. And I in a part of the world where
there's a lot of transportation infrastructure, but most of it is nearly
100 years old. So while it's nice that there *are* trains, it's also
apparent that the trains are designed to serve a reality which is
radically different from the one that people today occupy.

I think I'm drawn to stories about people living in worlds that are out
of sync with their reality. The story I'm writing now revolves around
this idea, using the problem of relativistic space travel as a device to
pull people "out of time," but I think there are ways that people's
relationship to their present is shifted without science fictional
devices: by history, by political rhetoric, by development, and by
illness.

The two ideas I've been playing with recently are:

-  a story about the people who build some sort of railroad system on a
new colony or outpost. I'm thinking *Mars Trilogy* (Robinson) meets
*Heart of Darkness* meets *Left Hand of Darkness* (Le Guin).

-  a story about a commuter on the Moon mid/post-\ *Accelerondo*. Sort
of "Philadelphia in Space." This is probably more of a short
story/vignette sequence, and I have a little bit sketched out but
it's all in first person and I need to make that not be the case.
