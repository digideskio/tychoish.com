My friend `Jo <http://jovanevery.com/>`__ wrote a post a while ago that
addressed the subject of building an audience for your scholarly work.
You can read `the post on her blog,

One of the things that I think Jo is really great at is thinking
practically about academic careers and trajectories in light of the
current academic job market. While people working in traditional
academic spaces and on a traditional academic course have a different
set of challenges than folks like me, her points still resonate.

How do you build networks and audiences? Two things:

1. You talk to people.

Audiences are built on relationships. While we might like to think that
writers and scholars are able to attract audiences purely on the basis
of their work, in practice additional work is required.

2. You make sure you have something to show for yourself.

Everyone's got ideas, and projects that they'd like to work on. People
*love* to talk about their ideas. Success, I think, comes when you have
something to show for yourself and your projects, and give people some
level of confidence that your can make good on your ideas.

In sort, write more, publish more. While quality matters some, being
more than someone to talks well at parties is really important.

I think this approach is useful for people doing any kind of creative or
intellectual work that engages an audience, but I'm interested in your
thoughts.
