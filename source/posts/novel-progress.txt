I've not been writing very much or very regularly in the new year,
unfortunately. I've had a lot of obligations at work, and I went to
visit my grandmother last weekend, which took a lot of time (both whilst
there, but also in preparation). And lets not talk about Critical
Futures, which is a full length post onto itself at this point. In any
case, I've been doing some work on the new novel, which I have managed
to put the finishing touches on the first third. I'm working on getting
things together--as preemptive as this might be--for a podcast
publication sometime later this year. The progress on the story
continues, and I like *everything* about the story. So there. Anyway. I
thought it would be fun to mark the "one third done" milestone. Here's
to the next third!
