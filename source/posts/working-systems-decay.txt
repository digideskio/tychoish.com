I wanted to write something, a week in about my experiences with
`OmniFocus <http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/>`__, so
here it is.

The truth is that I've been in a bit of a funk all week. Not writing,
while I figure out I need to do with this story. But I'm also spending a
more time this week knitting and sorting through things. I think some
time to sit back and reflect on what's going on before I dive into what
ever comes next.

Good plan? Right?

Right.

So as part of this reflect and regrouping I've been knitting more,
reports of this appear on the blog, so I won't bore you with this. I
also reorganized my files, which very much needed to happen. And I'm
using omnifocus.

I want to say that I absoultly love this app. Everything about it just
works the way you'd expect it to. There aren't bugs, it's pretty, and it
all works with a really robust data framework, *thingy*.

The problem is that *I* don't work very well with this program. I get a
lot of things done, and that's good but I'm not very good at doing my
project planning in a way that works with the whole system. Which is
something that I'm working on a little bit, but is still frustrating.

Such is life, I suppose.

Oh, and by the way I did a little bit of work with drupal last night.
I'm not sure that I'm making progress, but I have a better idea of what
needs to happen.

Onward and Upward!
