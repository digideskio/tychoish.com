1.  I feel like there should be blogging this morning, I however:

- have a test to study for.
- don't have a good TealArt entry for today
- don't have anything pithy to say here yet.

2.  I need a pair of black slacks. Bad. Also, laundry.
3.  Though unconfirmed, I think I'm going to "go out" with the boy this
evening. The question that lingers in my mind is, why I'm on the
whole so resistant to this. I like being social, and outgoing, and
I'm not always productive; but I don't *want to*. Sigh.
4.  I have yet to loose points on a graded piece of writing, but I
(somewhat comically, if you know me) lost points for not talking
more in a class. I'm still in A territory, so no worries.
5.  When did I turn out to be a grade whore?
6.  I wrote 1,100 words yesterday on the novella. I should be hapy about
that, but I feel like it should have been more like 1,500.
7.  Visor, an app by Alcor, the guy who did Quicksliver, is amazing and
rocks my world.
8.  I started a new sweater, and have cast on and knit the first pattern
row. It came out right on the first try, and by g-d it should be the
right size. I'd say that I'm following a pattern here, but that
isn't strictly true. I'm allowing myself to be inspired by a
pattern, and I'm following someone else's chart.
9.  I think in the process of starting the new sweater, I might have
injured my right hand slightly.
10. I have switched into a different, slightly smaller bookbag, and it
makes me happy, though I know I'm going to outgrow it pretty quickly
as my knitting project grows.
11. I think it's pretty cool that iPod touches have bluetooth in them.

That's all for now, I'm going to go pretended to be useful elsewhere.
I'll see you all later.
