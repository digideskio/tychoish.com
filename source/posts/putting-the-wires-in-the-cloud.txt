Putting the Wires in the Cloud

I'm thinking of canceling my home data connectivity and going with a
3G/4G wireless data connection from Sprint.

Here's the argument for it:

- I'm not home very much. I work a lot (and there is plenty of internet
  there), and I spend about two thirds of my weekends away from home.
  This is something that I expect will become more--rather than
  less--intense as time goes on. It doesn't make sense to pay for a
  full Internet connection here that I barely use.

- My bandwidth utilization is, I think, relatively low. I've turned on
  some monitoring tools, so I'll know a bit more later, but in general,
  most of my actual use of the data connection is in keeping an SSH
  connection with my server alive. I download email, refresh a few
  websites more obsessively than I'd like (but I'm getting better with
  that), and that's sort of it. I've also started running a reverse
  proxy because that makes some measure of sense.

- I find it difficult to use the data package on my cellphone. The fact
  that I get notified of all important emails on my phone, has
  disincentivized me from actually attending to my email in a useful
  way, and other than the occasional use of googlemaps (and I really
  should get an actual GPS to replace that...) If I get the right
  Wireless modem, however, it would be quasi-feasible to pipe my phone
  through the wireless Internet connection, so this might be a useful
  clarification.

The arguments against it are typical:

- The technology isn't terribly mature, or particularly well deployed.

- Metered bandwidth is undesirable.

- Sprint sucks, or has in my experience, and the other providers are
  worse.

The questions that remain in my mind are:

- How well do these services work in moving vehicles? Cars? Trains?

- How much bandwidth do I actually use?

- Is this practical?

Feedback is, as always, very much welcomed here. I'm not in a huge rush
to act, but I think it makes sense to feel things out. It also, I think
posses an interesting question about how I (and we) use the Internet. Is
the minimalist thing I do more idealistic than actual? I know that we
have a pretty hard time conceptualizing how big a gigabyte of data
actually is in practical usage. Further research is, clearly, indicated.

**Edit**: This plan would have to rely on the fact that I might be
spending a large amount of time in a city with unmetered 4G access with
sprint. I've used a gig and a half of transfer to my laptop's wireless
interface in 5 days. I think that would coincide with when I would be
doing the heaviest traffic anyway. *I wonder how unlimited the unlimited
is...*
