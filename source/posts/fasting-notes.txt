Several notes to with regards to `information
fast <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/glitch-and-web-experiments/>`__ that
I'm undertaking. And because this is the internet and this is my blog...
Well here goes:

- I had initially suspected that the cause of my ailment was the
  special thinkpad-track point driver that deals with scrolling didn't
  get updated when I `upgraded to
  jaunty <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/jaunty-upgrade/>`__. This turns
  out to not be the case, as I had a freeze (again in firefox) just
  moving around with the arrow keys. That theory gone.

- `C.K. <http://www.cgkreality.com/>`__ and I determined that--counter
  to my supposition--the slight/occasional clunking noise is probably
  the drive head parking itself, and doesn't seems to correspond with
  the problem. So replacing the drive is both awkward (weird form
  factor) and not likely to fix the problem

- I installed emacs-w3m on both computers. It's not entirely intuitive.
  There are debian/ubuntu packages, but if you install the
  `emacs-snapshot <http://emacs.orebokech.com/>`__ package, then the
  sequence is upgrade to the latest emacs-snapshot, install w3m-el,
  uninstall emacs22, and then add w3m code to your emacs init file
  (.emacs).

  It's, remarkably nice, particularly for looking up links while I'm
  writing something and reading content-rich pages. The key-bindings are,
  by default *excessively lame* and require attention (which I haven't
  figured out yet). I always thought that emacs web-browsing was way too
  dweab-y for me, but learning that it's actually really cool is a good
  thing indeed.

- This isn't a real fast, as I am still using firefox a little bit bit,
  and I suspect that I'll always need to have it installed, but I think
  it's generally good to not have firefox be the default environment
  for *everything* that isn't emacs or the terminal.

- I've basically been avoiding my RSS reader during the course of this
  experiment. Which I need to spend some time tending to, at least so
  that I can start using some other reader. This has been an issue
  since I switched to Linux, and I've failed to come to anything that I
  really like. I'm tempted to use the gnus news reader to read the RSS,
  but I fear this might be incredibly awkward/complciated for a very
  small amount of pay off.

- By moving web browsing, insofar as it needs to occur, into emacs, the
  windows I see are: stuff inside of emacs (mostly org-mode and
  writing); and stuff inside of terminals (mutt, Micawber, bash, etc.).
  As a result, I get the feeling that *all of my windows look the
  same*. I'm interested how people might solve this problem themselves.
  How do you make an entirely text-driven, undecorated environment have
  texture? Have... variety between windows that might provide some
  context to specific tasks.

  This is an aesthetic/design question more than a programmatic one I
  guess. I've tried playing around, a little with colors in emacs, and
  still use the default for emacs23 because the others seem difficult to
  read. I've tried different fonts (in both programs) and I'm quite wed to
  my current font. I've tried transparency (which doesn't run well for
  emacs on the laptop)... I'm thinking that adding Conky, or more
  informative widgets might be helpful, but I'd love to get some feedback
  from you all...
