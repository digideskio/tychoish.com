I've found all sorts of nifty new people who are now my twitter friends.
I want them to be new virtual friends, but we'll see. my standards a
low.

Anyway, I'm going to go to bed because I'm clearly not coherent enough
to read or write. with luck I'll have something for you all by the
evening....

[in the distance] brain where have you gone?
