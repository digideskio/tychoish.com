Freaky? Economics > "This is a book about feminism and racism written
for people who feel either uncomfortable or unwelcome in the great
conversation North American society has been having about feminism and
racism since the 1960s. It presents an authoritative alternate language
in which — not to participate in, but—to dominate that conversation.
Dubner and Levitt assure their readers that ‘economics’ is the
value-free idiom with respect to which those other, value-laden, idioms
can be shown to be misguided at best, stupid at worst, and almost always
dead wrong."

(Via Savage Minds: Notes and Queries in Anthropology — A Group Blog.)

Savage Minds is something I've really enjoyed a lot in the past few
weeks, so you should check it out, but I really liked this analyis of
the pop-social science, book "Freakenomics."

I must admit that I haven't really read this book, and I really have no
interest, but a lot of people seem to like it which I totally find
troubling. Here's a book which takes social science in the wrong
direction: reductive; objective-oriented; and quantitative superiority.
Which while not without its merit, is deplorable at its best because it
works to invalidate alternate methods and ways of knowing. Which in this
case is not at all called for. In my humble opinion. So there.

Cheers, Sam
