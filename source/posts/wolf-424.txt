From the Wikipedia page on `Wolf
424 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_424>`__

Due to its proximity and fast motion towards the Sun, Wolf 424 will
brighten by more than 2% over the course of the 21st century. In
approximately 7700 years it will make its nearest approach at a
distance of about 1 light year.

See ya in 9700.

And here's a picture for your records:

A light year is pretty darn close, and astronomically, 7k years isn't
that long at all. I'm thinking someone needs to write a story.

As I've thought about this some more, I've realized (with the help of
wikipedia) that Wolf 242 is moving, relative to the speed of the Solar
System, at 555km/s, which is almost 2 percent of light speed. [1]_
Right? There has to be a story in this.

.. [1] Am I the only one to think that it's really cool that google will
   calculate C, the speed of light, from the search bar?
