The Inevitability of Open Source

I recently attended `POSSCON <http://posscon.org>`__ as part of my
day-job. I don't usually blog directly about this kind of stuff ("You
like to keep your church and state separate," a fellow attendee said,
which fits.) But, I had a number of awesome conversations with the
speakers, attendees and sponsors, that may spawn a series of brief posts
here. POSSCON is a regional open source convention that drew developers,
leaders of informational technology departments, and IT consultants of
various types.

I had a number of conversations that revolved around the adoption of
open source in opposition to proprietary systems. People asked questions
like "what do we have to do to get more people to use open source
software?" and many people apologized for doing work with proprietary
software for mostly economic reasons (e.g. "I have a .NET development
job," or "people need windows administration and I can't turn away
work.")

This led me to have one of three reactions:

1. Working with any specific (proprietary) technology, particularly
because you have to make ends meet should never require excusing.
There are cases where "working with proprietary technology," may more
like "building a business model on proprietary technology," and that
sort of thing needs to be watched out for, but I don't think it's
morally ambiguous to make a living.

2. I'm not sure that the success of technology, particularly open
source, is determined solely on the basis of adoption rates.
Successful technology is technology that efficiently allows
people/cyborgs to do work, not overwhelmingly ubiquitous technology.

3. In many many contexts, open source technology *has* triumphed over
proprietary alternatives: Linux-based systems are the dominant
UNIX-like operating system. OpenSSH is the dominant SSH
implementation (and remote terminal protocol/implementation).
Darwin/FreeBSD is incredibly successful (as Mac OS X.) Other domains
where open source packages have very high (dominating) adoption
rates: OpenSSL, gcc, perl/python/php/ruby (web development),
Apache/Lighttpd/nginx (web servers) etc.

While I think the end-user desktop isn't *unimportant*, I think there
may be merit in playing to the strengths of open source (servers,
infrastructure, developers.) Additionally, it seems more productive to
have the discussion about "how do we advance open source," couched in
terms of a battle for technological dominance in which open source has
already won.

And Free Software/Open Source *has* won. While there remain sectors and
domains where non-free software remains prevalent and business models
that don't value user's freedom, I think that most people who know
anything about technology will say that all paths forward lead toward a
greater level of software freedom.

Maybe this is a symptom of the situation in which I work and maybe I'm
being too optimistic, but I don't think so. [[Thoughts\|discourse]]
