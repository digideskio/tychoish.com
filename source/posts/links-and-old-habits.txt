====================
Links and Old Habits
====================

So I've noticed that my impulse on these shorter blog posts (codas) that
I tend to just do my normal essay thing only shorter, which is more of
an old habit than it is something productive or intentional. Weird. To
help break out of this bad habit, I'm going to post some links that I've
collected recently.

I saw a couple of articles on user experience issues that piqued my
interest, perhaps they'll pique yours as well: `Agile Product Desgin on
Agile Development and UX
Practice <http://agileproductdesign.com/blog/emerging_best_agile_ux_practice.html>`__
and `On Technology, User Experience and the need for Creative
Technologists <http://www.arpitonline.com/blog/?p=178>`__.

`Cheetah Template Engine for
Python <http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/learn.html>`__. This isn't an
announcement but I've been toying around with the idea of reimplementing
`Jekyll <http://github.net/mojombo/jekyll/>`__ in python (to learn,
because I like python more than Ruby). Cheetah seems to be the template
engine for python that looks the coolest/best. I need to read more about
it, of course

I didn't get to go to Drupal Con (alas), but there were a few sessions
that piqued my interest, or at least that I'd like to look into mostly
because the presenters are people I know/watch/respect: `Sacha Chua's
Rocking your Development
Environment <http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/totally-rocking-your-development-environment>`__
`Liza Kindred's Bussiness and Open
Source <http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/business-open-source>`__
`James Walker's Why I Hate
Drupal <http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/why-i-hate-drupal>`__.

Sacha's because I'm always interested in how developers work, and we
have emacs in common. Liza's because Open Source business models are
really (perversely) fascinating, even if I think the Drupal world is
much less innovative (commercially) than you'd initially think. Finally,
given how grumpy I'm prone to being, how could walkah's talk not be on
my list?

Anyone have something good for me?
