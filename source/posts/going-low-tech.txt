`Going Low Tech <http://academhack.outsidethetext.com/home/?p=187>`__:

Okay so my whole desk is glass and metal, but the point is that the
top is glass. Even in you have a wooden desk you can get a glass or
Plexi-glass covering. Why? Because a glass desk makes for one large
dry erase surface. Forget needing to write things on pieces of paper
that get lost everywhere, just write straight onto the desk. This is
great for taking quick notes and I find it helps me to keep my desk
clear so that I can see my writing surface. Somebody walked in my
office the other day, thought I had defaced my desk. No, I
explained, its just the ultimate note taking surface. (I keep
multiple color pens handy as well, I find visualization is often
helped by changing colors.)

I actually really like this idea. Particularly if the desk has a
keyboard drawer that can be used to hold the laptop, otherwise I can see
it getting a bit messy in terms of of putting the laptop on top of a
surface... etc..
