Ok, I was crusing around raverly avoiding my writing and sipping my tea,
and I've found something *`amazing <http://gansey.blogspot.com/>`__*

This blog, called "`A Fisherman
Knits <http://gansey.blogspot.com/>`__\ " is a guy (Aaron) whose really
interested in traditional fisherman's sweaters (ganseys or guernsey) and
his blog is *brilliance* as it reports on various attempts to knit these
really stellar garments, and its all very systematic and brilliant.

He knits using long double points that he makes himself (I must learn
how to do this. there's a pair of steel 5/5.25 inch needles in my future
for socks, and maybe some 12 inch needles for a sweater) and I think
there's wisdom in this method.

Also interestingly he reports that he can wear these sweaters when it's
in the mid 60s comfortably (!) I always feel like my sweaters are too
warm if it's in the high fifties, so that's something that i have to
investigate.

Anyway, go forth and read.

Periscope down!
