hello my fellows.

I've gotten a *huge* rise in traffic from posting the content of a
`message I got in spam <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/asimov-spam/>`__. I
hope you all are enjoying the rest of the stuff we have here.

Also the books are good. The quote is from one of Asimov's foundation
books, not sure which. While I generally detest spam, and don't want to
hear about breast enlargement, or cheap prescription medications, I
think a little bit of fine fiction is totally acceptable. Though I would
concede that moderation in all things is the way to go on this.

Have a good day!
