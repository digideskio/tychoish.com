Documentation Tooling
=====================

I've spent a little bit of time building some non-critical tools for my
teammates on my work project, which has got me thinking about tooling
for documentation systems.

This collection of tools is something that we've started to take for
granted, but I think it's pretty novel and worth talking about a bit
more.

--------------

Documentation toolkits, traditionally refer to the system that deals
with the production of the documentation for end use, which typically
means taking the source text and rendering it into web sites, pdfs,
ebooks, and embedded "online help" text.

These toolkits are really important and I think one of the *best* things
you can do for a documentation tool kit is to produce documentation
using a tool specifically designed to address the needs of documentation
projects and technical writers.

Unfortunately, documentation *production* is mostly for *readers* and
business owners of documentation and not really for the writers. Tooling
for documentation, particularly the kind that I've been spending time on
recently is about making documentation easier to maintain, and easier to
improve *at scale.* For example:

-  tools to make common textual chunks easier to reuse.
-  tools that enforce common structures.
-  tools that detect common patterns of weak constructions.
-  tools that that analyize text for common readability conventions.

I was going to write this up as a blog post, but I think it makes sense
as a collection of wiki pages:

-  [[Inclusion Management
Tools\|/technical-writing/inclusion-management]]
-  [[Structured Content
Generation\|/technical-writing/structured-content-generation]]
-  [[Static Analysis of Text\|/technical-writing/static-analysis]]

Onward and Upward!
