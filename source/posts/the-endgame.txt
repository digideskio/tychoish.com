The Endgame

As I draw to the end of the novella, I realize that I'm not quite ready
for it to be over.

When I was finishing up Chapter #8, I had in my mind that I had two
chapters left to write. While I wrote a couple of chapters in a very
short period of time, for the most part 2 more meant that I had a couple
more weeks to deal with the material.

My realization a few hours ago, that I really only had a smidgen more
than a chapter's worth of material, has sort of put me into a bit of a
scare. This project has been a guiding force for a long time, like
sweaters can be, frankly, so knowing that I'm close to having to let go
and move on is hard. To make matters worse, I'm not sure that I'm far
enough along on the planning of the next novel to begin to write it. The
upside to this point is that planning is one of those things that I'm
pretty good at just doing without thinking much about it, unlike
writing.

So knowing that, I'm going to go sit down with my pen and moleskin and
see what comes out.
