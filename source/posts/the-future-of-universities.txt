the future of universities

One element that has been largely missing from my ongoing rambling
analysis of economies, corporations, co-ops, and institutions has been
higher education and universities. Of course Universities are
institutions, and function in many ways like `large
corporations <http://tychoish.com/posts/the-evil-corporations>`__,
but, nostalgia notwithstanding, I don't think it's really possible to
exempt Universities or dismiss them from this conversation.

Oh, and, there was this rather interesting--but remarkably
mundane--\ `article that I clipped
recently <http://www.deseretnews.com/article/print/705298649/Universities-will-be-irrelevant-by-2020-Y-professor-says.html>`__
about that addressed where universities are "going" in the next decade
or two. I say mundane, because I think the "look there's new technology
that's changing the rules game" is crappy futurism, and really fails to
get at the core of what kinds of developments we may expect to see in
the coming years.

Nevertheless... Shall we begin? I think so:

- The expansion of university in the last 60 years, or so, has been
  fueled by the GI-Bill and the expansion of the student-loan
  industry.  With the "population bubble" changing, and the credit
  market changing, universities will have to change. How they change
  is of course up in the air.

- There aren't many alternatives to "liberal arts/general education"
  post-secondary education for people who don't want, need, or have
  the preparation for that kind of education at age 18. While I'm a
  big proponent (and product of) a liberal arts education, there are
  many paths to becoming a well rounded and well educated adult, and
  they don't all lead through traditional-four-year college educations
  (or equivalents, particularly at age 18.)

- Technology is changing higher education and scholarship, already,
  with all likelihood faster than technology has been and is changing
  other aspects of our culture (publishing, media production, civic
  engagement, etc.). Like all of these developments of culture,
  however, the changes in higher education are probably not as
  revolutionary as the article suggests.

- There will probably always be a way in which degree granting
  institutions will be a "useful" part of our society, but I think
  "The College," will probably change significantly, but I think
  forthcoming changes probably have less to do with education and the
  classroom, and more to do with the evolving role of the faculty.

- As part of the decline of tenure-systems, I expect that eventually
  we'll see a greater separation (but not total disconnect) between
  the institutions which employ and sponsor scholarship, and the
  institutions that educate students.

- It strikes me that most of the systems that universities use to
  convey education online (Blackboard, moodle, etc.,) are hopelessly
  flawed. Either by virtue of being difficult and "gawky" to use, or
  because they're proprietary systems, or that they're not designed
  for the task at hand, all of the systems that I'm aware of are as
  much roadblocks to the adoption of new technology in education as
  anything else.

- Although quality information (effectively presented, even) is
  increasingly available online for free, what makes this information
  valuable in the university setting, including interactivity,
  feedback on progress, individual attention, validation and
  certification of mastery, are all of the things that universities
  (particularly "research"-grade institutions) perform least
  successfully at.

- We've been seeing research and popular press stuff on the phenomena
  of "prolonged adolescence," where young people tend to have a period
  of several years post-graduation where they have to figure out "what
  next," sometimes there's graduate school, sometimes there's odd
  jobs.  I've become convinced that in an effort to help fill the gap
  between "vocational education" and "liberal arts/gen ed." we've
  gotten to the point where we ask people who are 18 (and don't have a
  clue what they want to do with their lives, for the most part) to
  make decisions about their careers that are pretty absurd. Other
  kinds of educational options should exist, that might help resolve
  this issue.

Interestingly these thoughts didn't have very much to do with
technology. I guess I mostly feel that the changes in technology are
secondary to the larger economic forces likely to affect universities in
the coming years. `Unless the singularity comes
first <http://tychoish.com/posts/the-dark-singularity/>`__.

Your thoughts, as always, are more than welcome.
