Things you should know about, dear readers:

1. I published a book and released a *mess* under the banner of the new
`Cyborg Institute <http://cyborginstitute.org>`__. These projects
are:

- `Systems Administration for
Cyborgs <http://cyborginstitute.org/projects/administration/>`__

This is a high level guide that introduces key systems administration
knowledge domains and concepts. Possible subtitles include: "How to
think like a systems administrator," or "Just add ``man`` pages."

Read it now. Tell your friends. And please, send feedback and
comments.

- `Taskfile <http://cyborginstitute.org/projects/taskfile>`__

Rather than use `org-mode <http://orgmode.org>`__, I've taken to
using a sort of hacked together makefile that aggregates task items
from other textfiles. It works surprisingly well.

- `stl <http://cyborginstitute.org/projects/stl>`__

The idea behind this script is that it would provide a good way to
report activity in a regular way so that I'd be able to look back
over a log file and see how much I'd written (i.e. report word
counts,) and also do a bunch of other straightforward reporting and
logging.

I plan to do a revision of this that's a bit less complicated and a
bit more modular, but it's a nice proof of concept.

- `stack <http://cyborginstitute.org/projects/stack>`__

I've been meaning to publish this for a long time, but this project
contains configuration files for emacs and StumpWM, with other
systems to follow.

2. I've made a bunch of wiki pages on [[Information
Debt\|/technical-writing/information-debt]]. Current pages include:

- [[/technical-writing/books]]
- [[/technical-writing/taxonomy]]
- [[/technical-writing/wiki]]
- [[/technical-writing/document-management]]
- [[/technical-writing/hierarchy]]

3. I was planning on speaking at the `Open Help
Conference <http://openhelpconference.com/>`__, on August 10-15th,
2012. But then, United Airlines canceled my flight and I spent the
day in Terminal C of Newark Airport and ultimately couldn't make it
for the conference. Which is a huge shame. My talk was going to be is
about involving developers in documentation processes, about
maintaining documentation, and about working with documentation "as
code."

The site I made for the talk is at:

http://tychoish.net/oh-2012

And the last draft of the slides are at:

(*I was speaking on behalf of `10gen <http://10gen.com/>`__, my
employer, `MongoDB <http://docs.mongodb.org/>`__ `documentation
project <http://docs.mongodb.org/>`__ that I work on by day (and
sometimes night.)*)
