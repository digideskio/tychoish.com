New Fronts and a Prime Directive

As of 11 am Thursday, 19 December 2002 I was finished with the work and
all the exams for this semester are completed. Thank God. Also it's
really nice that I don't have to go back to school until the 6th of
January. I need the time to rest, recuperate, and recharge, and also to
do some of the things that I haven't been able to do for the past few
months. Writing, reading, computer coding, and staying up and going to
bed really late are all fairly high on my list.

I've also been working with Amy to get TealArt converted to the new
Quarto CMS. It's going really well, and I have two files that I need to
create, one that needs to be fixed and two functions that aren't working
the way they should. The file that doesn't work is a related problem to
the functions that aren't working, I think; but my knowledge of such
things is somewhat limited as anyone who's ever helped me with PHP will
attest to. In a few days we'll get there.

One of the things that Amy said in her weblog at one point that I'll
probably talk about more latter is that she "saves the present and
future for herself and writes about the past for her site" (a rough
paraphrase, I'll get the entry at some point.) This really struck me,
and I think its something that might separate a good weblog from a lousy
one (the term is used loosely). This should be the prime directive of
blogging. *Go Forth, he said, and Write only about the Past.* So there.
