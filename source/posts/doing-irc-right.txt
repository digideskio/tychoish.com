Doing IRC right

A couple of weeks ago (wow, it's been a couple of weeks!), a new
`twitter <http://twitter.com/>`__-like service called
`identi.ca <http://identi.ca/>`__ started up. It's open source, and
incorporates a lot of "duh" features that twitter doesn't yet have, so
I'm a fan in general, but I think it's doomed to fail ultimately because
it doesn't have the community that twitter has--yet, and I don't think
that it will, ever.

With another new 140-character micro blogging service I had a series of
conversations with `bear <http://code-bear.com/bearlog/>`__ about these
kids of sites, the social niche that they occupy and the technology
that's behind them.

I should start by saying that I really like twitter, and I think that
the ultra-short form totally has a niche. I think the problem with
`identica <http://www.identica.com/>`__, which it inherited from
twitter, is that their social plan is out of sync with their
technological plan. [1]_

Twitter has, of course, been plagued by horrible scaling problems. I
think initially twitter expected everyone to *actually* answer the
framing question "What are you doing?" So that each individual's stream
would be like a more or less isolated "microblog." And their software
was developed in this direction.

And then "the community," happened, and it turns out that what people
*really* want from their twitter-like services is not a place where they
can record "what they're doing," but talk publicly with a group of
friends.

Enter the "fail whale:" the problem with this usage model is that people
check it much more regularly, they update more regularly, and with the
site not really built for this kind of usage, there are a lot of error
messages, lost messages, and the like. While it's taken twitter a while
to sort this out--and they are getting better--the problem remains that
twitters users and twitters initial designers have/had two very
different sites in mind. And because of the problems that twitter's had
(and because of it's great success) there have been a lot of sites that
basically duplicates twitters functionality.

This is all fine and good *except* that the fact that twitter is the
wrong thing to copy. My conclusion from the post-identi.ca-launch
discussion was that, "the next twitter-like service to make it *isn't*
going to get twitter right, for once and for all; but rather, the next
twitter 'killer' will get
`IRC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat>`__ right, at
last."

IRC is the original internet chat platform. It's not without it's
problems, both social and technical. Basically you have to have a live
connection to use IRC, there's no "offline." It also doesn't scale
*much* more effectively than twitter, and there's no way to
filter/organize the community on IRC except through really route
tools[^socirc]. The really interesting thing is that people are more
prone to using twitter like IRC, and less like blogger or live journal
(which you have to imagine is what they thought that it would be like.)
[^socirc]: The issue is that if a channel on IRC gets overridden with
spam, or annoying people, or just volume, the only option is to start
kicking people out, or to start a new channel, which can be sort of
draconian.

So what would "a better IRC be?" I don't know, I'm just a guy, right,
but here's what I'd like to see:

1.  Integration with the web in a way that doesn't suck. There have
always been webapplets for IRC, but they have always sucked. This
can't continue.
2.  You shouldn't have to be online to record a conversation.
3.  Unlike twitter, the offline apps need to be as good if not better
than the web site.
4.  Arbitrary rooms, "moments" and streams need to be constructed on the
fly by users. The randomness of twitter is something new, that--now
that we know it's there--is something we want.
5.  Everyone should be able to intuitively construct filtering
mechanisms.
6.  Chat "moments" and cork-board "moments" should both be possible to
construct, but
7.  No one should have to think about the infrastructure (this is a
problem for both IRC and twitter.)
8.  Identity needs to be managed coherently.
`Jabber <http://www.jabber.org/>`__/`XMPP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Messaging_and_Presence_Protocol>`__
seems like an ideal tool for this project.
9.  Also identitiy management and community organization seems like the
"niche" for private enterprise to fill, rather than infrastructure,
which I think can be decentralized.
10. Threaded conversations. It's a must.

Anyone have anything to add to this?

Onward and `Upward <http://criticalfutures.com>`__!

In a way, I suspect this qualifies as "writing a job for yourself,"
in to your analysis. My secret superpower, it seems is to look at
what people are doing, and then talk to the engineers about the
social realities. Any web 2.x people who want this, be in touch ;)
