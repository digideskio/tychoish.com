Act One
-------

This post is inspired by three converging observations:

1. `Matt <http://identi.ca/madalu>`__ posted a comment to a `previous
post <http://www.tychoish.com/2009/06/things-i-hate-about-the-internet/>`__:
that read:

"Cloud" computing. Seriously. Do we really want to give up that much
control over our computing? In the dystopian future celebrated by
many tech bloggers, computers will be locked down appliances, and we
will rely on big companies to deliver services to us.

2. A number of `podcasts <http://redmonk.libsyn.com/>`__ that I listened
to while I drove to New Jersey produced/hosted/etc. by `Michael
Cote <http://www.peopleoverprocess.com/>`__ for
`RedMonk <http://www.redmonk.com>`__ that discussed current events
and trends in "Enterprise-grade Information Technology," which is a
world, that I'm only beginning to scratch the surface of.

3. Because my Internet connection at home is somewhat spotty, and
because it makes sense have an always on (and mobile) connection to
IRC for work, I've started running my chat clients
(`mcabber <http://www.mcabber.com/>`__ and
`irssi <http://www.irssi.org>`__) inside of a `gnu
screen <http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/>`__ session on my
`server <http://www.linode.com>`__.

--------------

My specific responses:

1. Matt's right, from a certain perspective. There's a lot of
buzz-word-heavy, venture capital driven, consumer targeted "cloud
computing tools" which seem to be all about getting people to use
web-based "applications," and give up
`autonomy <http://www.autonomo.us>`__ in exchange for data that *may*
be more available to us because it's stored on someones network.

Really, however, I think this isn't so much a problem with "networked
computing," as it is with both existing business models for information
technology, and an example of the worst kind of cloud computing. And I'm
using Matt's statement as a bit of a straw man, as a lot of the things
that I'm including under the general heading of "cloud computing,"
aren't really what Matt's talking about above.

At the same time I think there is the cloud that Matt refers to: the
Google/Microsoft/Startup/Ubuntu One/etc. cloud, and then there's all the
rest of distributed/networked/infrastructural computing which isn't new
or sexy, but I think is really the same as the rest of the cloud.

2. The "enterprise" world thinks about computers in a much different way
than I ever do. Sometimes this is frustrating: the tendrils of
proprietary software are strongest here, and enterprise folks care
*way too much* about Java. In other aspects it's really fascinating,
because technology becomes an infrastructural resource, rather than a
concrete tool which accomplishes a specific task.

Enterprise hardware and software exists to provide large corporate
institutions the tools to manage large amounts of
data/projects/data/communications/etc.

This is, I think on some level, the real cloud. This
"technology-as-infrastructure" thing.

3. In an elaboration of the above, I outsourced a chunk of my computing
to "the cloud." I could run those applications locally, and I haven't
given up that possibility, but one needs a network connection to use
a chat client, so the realm of possibilities where I would want to
connect to a chat server, but wouldn't be able to connect to my
server, is next to impossible (particularly because some of the chat
servers run on *my* hardware.).

--------------

I guess the point I'm driving at is: maybe this "cloud thing" isn't
about functionality, or websites, or software, or business models, but
rather about the evolution of our computing needs from providing a set
of tools and localized resources to providing infrastructure.

And that the shift isn't so much about the technology: in point of fact
running a terminal application in a screen session over SSH isn't a
cutting edge technology by any means, but rather about how we use the
technology to support what it is we do.

Or am I totally off my rocker here?
