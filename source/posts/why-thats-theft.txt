I'm sitting in one of the local cafe shops waiting for a friend as I
write this (but not, as you will soon learn as you read this) because
this fine establishment charges what I think of as "through the nose"
for internet access. What's through the nose? 10 cents a minute, per
hour, or ten dollars for a day. The issue is that this would mean that
the provider (which isn't the cafe) is making a *hefty* profit from all
this, even though we've already basically paid our dues for the
privilege to sit here.

When will they learn?

I reman, yours in the struggle, tycho

ps. I would like to say that I conned this place into making what
amounts to a mango lhasi (like you get in indian restaurant.) Despite
the sucky internet, I'm quite happy.

pps. This is what happens when I don't get access to twitter
http://www.twitter.com/tychoish/; aparently there is freqireless, but
someone else, that has a stronger signal, has pay wireless. All is well
and right with the world.
