Installing Mcabber .10-rc3 on Debian Lenny
==========================================

mcabber is console based XMPP or Jabber client. It runs happily within a
screen session, its lightweight, and it does all of the basic things
that you want from an IM client without being annoying and distracting.
For the first time since I started using this software a year or two
ago, there's a major release that has some pretty exciting features. So
I wanted to install it. Except, there aren't packages for it for Debian
Lenny, and I have a standing policy that everything needs to be
installed using package management tools so that things don't break down
the line.

These instructions are written for Debian 5.0 (Lenny) systems. Your
millage may vary for other systems, or other versions of Ubuntu. Begin
by installing some dependencies:

::

apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5 libncursesw5-dev pkg-config libglib2.0-dev libloudmouth1-dev

The following optional dependencies provide additional features, and may
already be installed on your system:

::

apt-get install libenchant-dev libaspell-dev libgpgme-dev libotr-dev

When the dependencies are installed, issue the following commands to
download the latest release into the ``/opt/`` directory, unarchive the
tarball, and run the configure script to install mcabber into the
``/opt/mcabber/`` folder so that it is easy to remove later if something
stops working.

::

cd /opt/
wget http://mcabber.com/files/mcabber-0.10.0-rc3.tar.gz
tar -zxvf mcabber-0.10.0-rc3.tar.gz
./configure --prefix=/opt/mcabber

When that process finishes, run the following:

::

make
make install

Now copy the following ``/opt/mcabber-0.10-rc3/mcabberrc.example`` file
into your home directory. If you don't already have mcabber configured,
you can use the following command to copy the file to your home
directory.

::

cp /opt/mcabber-0.10-rc3/mcabberrc.example ~/.mcabberrc

If you do have an existing mcaber setup, then use the following command
to copy the example configuration file to a non-overlapping folder in
your home directory

::

cp /opt/mcabber-0.10-rc3/mcabberrc.example ~/mcabber-config

Edit the ``~/.mcabberrc`` or ``~/mcabber-config`` as described in the
config file. Then start mcabber with the following command, if your
config file is located at ``~/.mcabberrc``:

::

/opt/mcabber/bin/mcabber

If you have your mcabber config located at ``~/mcabber-config`` start
mcabber with the following command:

::

/opt/mcabber/bin/mcabber -f ~/mcabber-config

And you're ready to go. Important things to note:

1. If something gets, as we say in the biz "fuxed," simply
"``rm rf    /opt/mcabber/``\ " and reinstall.

2. Check `mcabber <http://mcabber.com/>`__ for new releases and release
candidates. These instructions should work well once there's a final
release, at least for Debian Lenny. The release files are located
`here <http://mcabber.com/files/>`__.

3. Make sure to stay up to date with new releases to avoid bugs and
potential security issues. If you come across bugs, report them to
the
`developers <http://www.bitbucket.org/McKael/mcabber-crew/issues/?status=new&status=open>`__
there is also a MUC for the mcabber community here:
xmpp:mcabber@conf.lilotux.net.

4. If you have an additional dependency that I missed in this
installation do be in touch and I'll get it added here.

5. Debian Lenny ships with version 0.9.7 of mcabber. If you don't want
to play with the new features and the magic in 0.10, then go for it.
If you just want a regular client, install the stable mcabber with
the "``apt-get install mcabber``\ " command and ignore the rest of
this email.
