notebooks and hems

Long story made short:

I'd been caring a moleskin around for months that was just about full
and totally biting the dust. So I bought a "reporter" style notebook,
because I'm lefthanded and didn't want to be constantly smearing my
work.

Alas, what I didn't realize is that I mostly use it for reference, and
it's hard if you have something longer in the book and have to
constantly be changing the orientation of the book while you're looking
for pages.

So I abandoned it, took out my pages and have given it to my mother. I
got a new one.

So I'm finally done getting the past several weeks of work/notes out of
it and into the computer. It was good to get the notes taken care of.
Which means I'm mostly done with my work for tonight. I could rearrange
some of my `Geek Tool <http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/>`__
notes, and maybe make some notes for tomorrow's writing.

Also my knitting is still in the never ending hem, but I think I only
have 3 more rounds before I can bind off and sew it down. Another
sweater done, sans sleeves, but I'll have to do a little better with
this, because I think this is going to be a brilliant sweater to wear.
I'd like to note that I haven't yet started the next sweater, which
shows great personal restraint on my part.

Be Well
