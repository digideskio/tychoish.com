Here's a basic report for today, with a more detailed list to follow:

Today was a weird day. I spent my morning doing some programing/computer
things. (Kludge firmly planted in fist), and then I helped a friend do
some moving (more tomorrow.) I got a little bit of writing in and then
there's a dinner party and probably some knitting, and then bed. Sweater
class tomorrow.

- I didn't sleep enough last night; I was too wired from the drive, I
  had that low level awareness that you need for drives, but I was
  bodily exhausted. So sleeping was hard.

- I decided on my trip, as I mentioned last night, that I have a new
  vision for *Breakout,* I have a Kludgey solution that will make this
  technically possible, and I'm looking forward to it.

- Basically I'm going to do Breakout as a hypertext *thingy*. I
  guess in a way this means that there will never be a Breakout
  novel. Which is ok. It frees some energies up because I think I
  want to play with shorter forms for a while. I think I'd like to
  write another novella/novelette, and this will give me the chance
  to do that.

- The hypertext will let me write this story without having to fight
  it. I think a lot of fiction writing, in the traditional mode, is
  all about making *that thing in your head* get to other people in
  a common format. To use a computer metaphor, the Novel is like
  being restricted to communicate the content of your mind via the
  WiFi standard: you have to transmit your radio signal in a very
  precise sort of way. This hypertext, I hope, will be more like
  speaking, in contrast.

- My coding/programing thing, was just to make sure that I could
  script the deployment of this system in a way that I was
  comfortable scaling as the project grew from a few thousand words
  to several tens of thousands of words, and from a couple of dozen
  pages to many dozens of pages. Someday, I'll write about that,
  because I think getting the content to work the way I want it, is
  probably actually pretty easy, and it might be good for other
  people to have this information.

- I'm not going to have any sort of release for a long time, I
  should disclaim, but I'm working on it in a new way.

- I haven't done any work on the new TealArt site. And Breakout would
  probably be out at both TealArt and tychoish, in the end.

- I haven't knit anything. I made a mistake, as I might have mentioned
  the other day, and haven't brought myself to deal with it yet. My
  sock bag is still in the car, so I don't really have anything else to
  work on, so with luck I'll have fixed it by the end of the evening.

- Randal Schwartz, one of the hosts behind the open source podcast
  (FLOSS "Weekly") I `mentioned
  yesterday <http://tychoish.com/posts/drive-brain/>`__, saw the
  google juice and commented (woot! auto-notifiers, I suppose; not
  linking to it in this post for that reason I guess.) It's not
  actually a weekly, which is fine by me, because I am all sorts of
  behind on my podcast listening.

Ok, this entry is cooked, and so is, I think dinner. So I'm going to
jet! Have a good weekend. I'll be back tomorrow...

Onward and Upward!
