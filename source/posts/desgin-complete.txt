By g-d, friends I think I have the design here complete. I'm actually
pretty happy with it, though it's certainly true that I haven't put it
through it's full tests, so breakage is prone.

I need to set up the static pages, but I'm pretty happy with this. I'm
thinking of buying a new domain. For such a web-guy, I think having one
domain is excessively reasonable, but I need to think about these
things, of course.

On to other projects.

**update:** ha! this post fucked up the desgin. time to fiddle with CSS
again!

**update:** ok, we're back, and I think I may have realized why it
wasn't behaving the right way the first time. this is much more logical.
just have to make the tags work a bit better, but that shouldn't be
hard... (famous last words, I know)
