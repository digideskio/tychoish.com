LaTeX screenplays

So I know there are `LaTeX screenplay
classes <http://www.tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texmf-dist/doc/latex/screenplay/>`__
but I'd like to know if it would be possible to to take the output of
scripts I write in `TextMate with screenwriting
bundle <http://ollieman.net/screenbundle/>`__, and put them into LaTeX.
Also, would it be possible, then, with the LaTeX to have continued and
other niftiness that the "prince" implementation doesn't have?

I think the answer to my question is "yes" but I need to find a way to
script this properly, I think a number of properly placed RegExp find
and replaces could do the trick, and I think one could make that work
with a TextMate macro, and a couple of snippets... But ruby or perl
would be more efficient, I think, unfortunately I"m inept.

Just a thought...

Cheers, tycho
