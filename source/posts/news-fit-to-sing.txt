It's sometimes easy to forget all of the little things that I do during
the week, and how they add up to something of note. In the moment--any
moment--most things seem much smaller and much less important than they
do with a little bit of perspective and when viewed out of context with
coordinating achievements. So here's the highlights from last week:

I gave up on the "having two sites to maintain thing," and have merged
:doc:`Critical Futures </posts>` back into the tychoish.com blog/wiki. I
really like this, and it gave me some time to get elbows deep into the
wiki system, which means things work better, the display is a bit
cleaner, my life is easier, and I'm very happy with it. Also, as part of
this process I've been revising the index page, and I think it is in
a state that I'm really pleased with.

Some dancing friends on Facebook said "wouldn't it be nice if there was
a wiki for contra dancers." Now there is. `Contra Dance
Wiki <http://contra.balanceandsing.com>`__ is there for you all if
you want it. I've done some preparatory work on the index page, and I'll
continue to add things as I can.

The work I've been doing in the last few weeks with
`ikiwiki <http://ikiwiki.info>`__, both for tychoish and now for the CDW
means that I'm *really* close to being able to share all of the assorted
templates and configuration files I use to make this work. It's all in
the git repository for *tychoish*, but I'm going to pull together a more
generic version so people can get started easier. It might also make
sense to write a deployment script of sorts. We'll see.

I meant to post this on Friday, but posted my review of :doc:`maple morris </posts/maple-morris-review>`,
because I didn't want that to linger. In any case, I had a brilliant
weekend singing (and dancing) in Western Massachusetts. It has however
left me a bit under the weather, so I'm spending a day recovering and
doing some writing. Good stuff there. I'll write about WMSHC soon.
