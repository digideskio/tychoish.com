-  I have 2 more rounds of this damned hem plus a bind off (yes I bind
off hems using a stretchy bind-off.)
-  By the time I post this I'll have a new episode of torchwood to
watch. Despite the last ep, being somewhat less than stellar.
-  I remember a past where I would write blog posts *about* things. I
need to start doing that again.
-  I remember that I promised to post one of the more finished pieces of
breakout. I will. soon.
-  I was just listening to a podcast about publishing and new media. At
the moment I get *really* excited about this sort of stuff. I want to
spend a lot of time working on building TealArt into the kind of hub
that I'm really interested in having. Part of me is actually sort of
anxious about being so interested and inspired by this; because I'm
feeling sort of "out of the loop" regarding academia at the moment...
Generally my anxiety level is lower than it has been, but
-  I suppose the prototypical blogger thing to do today would be to post
something sort of picturesque about theBoy (who hasn't been a
character on the blog lately.) But I am neither typical blogger, nor
particularly typical in the way that I manage romance. *Such is
life.*
-  I still want a new computer. I'm still waiting till April or May.
It's been particularly trying today for some reason.
-  LiveJournal is really cool. I've been thinking about writing some
sort of tychoish post on the subject, but haven't really gotten
around to it. LJ is, I think hard to fully grok, but I think it
really acomplishes a lot of the things that were really cool about
the very early Internet that I often lament like collaboration,
small-town style community, and anonymous identity stuff.
-  The premier journal for my field did a special issue on
sexuality--the first since 95. I have so much stuff to claw through.
Sigh.

See you on the other side, tycho
