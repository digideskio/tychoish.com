Ok, So even though I said we wouldn't do it. Even though I really didn't
want to do it. I did. We've compleatly changed databases, and CMS. This
time you probably *can* notice the difference.

Eventually you probably won't notice, but for now things are a little
ruff and most of the functions don't work or have been disabled while we
get the other pages to work.

For a number of weeks, all the old pages will work, and all your old
links should continue to function. Eventually they won't but for now I'm
leaving things up.

Just So you know.

Cheers, Sam
