I'm wearing my most recent new sweater today, it being finally, almost
cold enough for sweaters since I finished it.

That's not strictly true. This summer I worked in a film and media
archive doing some cataloging and digitization stuff, and it I damn near
froze my ass off. It was 90 outside, and I walked out of the house
wearing sweaters sometimes.

Anyway, so I'm wearing one of my sweaters and I quite like it. I'm not
sure that it's one of those perfect sweaters that I'll live in day in
and day out, but I think I do like it a good piece. Shetland is such
amazing yarn.

Sorry, no pictures.

In red sweater news, I've picked up the stitches around the armhole for
the second sleeve (!) and I'm just knitting the very end of the ribbing
on the first sleeve. It's good stuff. It's also all I want to work on
now, and I have emails to read, writing to revise, and a research
project with a prof to work on this afternoon. Sigh.

I also wrote a paper last night/this morning that I feel is... not as
good as what I could have done, it feels too much like the kind of stuff
I was doing a year ago, and while I think it was good for me to get in
touch with that again, as it serves as a good foundation for the work I
want to do in the future, at the same time... Ugg.
