*This started out as a comment `over
here <http://www.thomascrampton.com/2007/09/06/how-to-be-an-uber-blogger-by-cory-doctorow/>`__,
but I think has evolved into a blog post of it's own, so here's my
commentary*

I think this is pretty good advice, clearly, and the "hey folks, we're
taping over here," line was priceless. Well, maybe not priceless, but
that's the general idea.

I would like the offer commentary, on this advice, however:

I think the "don't make it hard for people to read your work," is good
universal advice, but it's not so much about blogging as it is, about
distribution and creation. I remember not so long ago that blogger
wouldn't publish full RSS feeds (or any feeds, possibly) and I had a
policy of not reading any blogger feeds for just this reason. So good
advice there, no surprise.

The "write wire-style" stories is also good advice, but it's
particularly good advice for blogs that are more like wireservices.
Like, `boing boing <http://www.boingboing.net/>`__, and
`slashdot <http://www.slashdot.org>`__. And in a lot of ways I read
these sites as if they were wire services, in search of tidbits that I
think would be interesting for my blog, or some-such. So if you were
writing a blog, like this, it's a great model to use.

This also assumes that the primary route of new traffic to the average
blog are are people browsing google or
`technorati <http://www.technocrati.com>`__, and while that's probably
true of blogs like `boing boing <http://www.boingboing.net/>`__, that's
far from a universal. For instance, for a great number of weeks a post
of mine on `TealArt <http://tychoish.com/>`__ called "`Cool
Nicknames <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/cool-nicknames/>`__\ " was my
incoming link from google, because people were googling "cool
nicknames." Now I would love if you thought that people coming in from
this search were looking for something other than a list of cool
nicknames, which I wasn't providing then, and am not likely to start any
time soon. And I know I wasn't following Cory's advice here, but still,
I'm not sure that this blog (and this is true for many blogs) are
providing the same kind of information that search engines are best at
finding, or that most people would think to look for on a search engine.

This means that, even if you write the best headlines and opening
sentences, you still won't get new readers, because you're writing
pieces about email organization, or the lessons of your latest science
fiction project, or thoughts on the collaboration model of open source
software for other sorts of projects. Even the people who are interested
in these things, and willing to read about them, probably wouldn't think
to browse google, looking for blogs. This leads me to an alternate mode
of "encouraging" blog discovery:

I see blogging as part of an ongoing conversation. Conversations that
I'm having with myself, conversations that I'm having with you the
readers about what's going on in my life, conversations that I'm having
with people who are (theoretically commenting on the blog), and
conversations--like this one--that I'm having with other bloggers.

People don't stumble into the conversations via search engines, they
stumble upon them by reading other parts of the conversation. By talking
to you in real life, by finding you in IRC rooms, or on listservs, by
reading other blogs that link to you, by reading your comments in other
peoples blogs, and by reading your comments in their blog.

While you still have to write regular blog entries (which is really
important, lets not forget that), reading and participating in other
blogs, and other parts of the internet community is at least as
important.

At least I think so, we'll see how it works out.
