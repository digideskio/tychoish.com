Ok, a confession: I totally ran out of my usual backlog of blog posts,
that keeps these pages humming with the signs of life despite the fact
that I don't have time to write a post every day, and often don't have
reliable weekend time to write blog posts. This hasn't happened in a few
months, so it's sort of disconcerting. One of the reasons why I ran out,
is that I've been busy doing non-writing things for a few weekends, but
a third (or forth?) weekend away from home was too much for my backlog
to bear, so here we are.

Here's a brief overview of what I've been up to and the kinds of
projects I'm working on, and what the near future holds:

-  I'm going to `Dance
Flury <http://www.danceflurry.org/festival/index.html>`__ in a couple
of weeks. I've not done the usual dance weekend thing before, aside
from the Morris Dance gathering I've been going to for years. I'm
really looking forward to it.

-  I'm trying to get a better handle on the blog. I do this binge cycle
thing with my blog posts, that leads to situations like the one that
I'm currently experiencing, but also doesn't *actually* mean that I
have spare time to write fiction in a way that I might like.

-  I'm working a bunch, and while every day is some kind of learning
experience, I think I've figured out (largely) how to do what I do in
a way that doesn't have me leaving every night feeling like a fraud.
There will be more learning curves, for sure, but it's nice to not
feel like I know what I'm doing.

-  I've been throwing around the idea of writing poetry (hynms) vaguely
in the tradition of the sacred harp. I'm not much of a poet, and the
project I have in mind is a little bit peculiar (but then, this is me
we're talking about, so lets not be too surprised.) At the same time
I'm irrationally interested in this project, and we'll see how it
goes.

-  I switched to using Chromium as my primary browser. There are still a
few plug-ins that I really liked on Firefox that aren't *quite* as
awesome or comfortable in their Chrome-equivalents, but it's *close*
and I'm sure it'll get there. I've been looking for a viable non-Mac
WebKit browser for a while, and am pretty happy with the Chrome.

-  Check out `git for writers </wikish/git-writing/>`__, wiki page that
I've been working on over at `wikish </wikish/>`__ to try and explore
how writers use and might use the git version control system to
manage their writing. Contribute if you like.

-  This weekend (yay! snowpocolypse) I hooked up my laptop to my desktop
rig, and have basically abandoned my desktop as a machine that I will
interact with directly. (I'm a server guy, so it'll get used.) This
means I'm using xrandr with StumpWM (pretty swank,) and I must say
that I love it. While I adore my laptop, and I really like only
having to manage one computer, having this "desktop" setup makes it
really perfect: I'm often most comfortable in desk chairs and I like
the bigger screen and a real keyboard. So it works well. At some
point I'll write up a more thorough account of how I hacked this
together.

Ok, this document has been open on my desktop for a few day and I don't
have anything new to add to it, so lets call it done.

Onward and Upward!
