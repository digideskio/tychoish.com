Thinking about Git

A collection of thoughts about git.

I caught news, somewhat late in the game, about a project called
"`Flashbake <http://bitbucketlabs.net/flashbake/>`__\ " which is a tool
to make git use-able for `non-programmers to take advantage of git
without needing to bother too much with thinking about how to use
git <http://www.boingboing.net/2009/02/13/flashbake-free-versi.html>`__.
(Which is needed because git is incredibly complex). I think this (and
tools like and derived from this) is really cool, and a train of thought
that I think we'd really benefit from enjoying. Here are some thoughts:

- What if, in combination with text converter tools, we had a tool that
  could: Take a text file written in markdown, and convert it to HTML
  and LaTeX and insert the output along side the source file in the
  repo.

- What if the LaTeX or HTML template was customizable

- What if it could also generate PDFs.

- What if it could do all this compilation from a GUI or a text-editor
  plug-in as well as (or in addition to the current cron-like
  interface).

I guess the inspiration for some of these features would be to make git
version-control work, totally without the command line interface.

I suppose (heh) that I should work on hacking some of this together, the
`flashbake code is on
github <http://wiki.github.com/commandline/flashbake>`__, of course.

I have another brief coding project to deal with before I get to deal
with this, but I think I think I'll take a stab at integrating some of
the automatic conversion stuff, and talk to some people about GUI
layers. `My branch will
be <http://github.com/tychoish/flashbake/tree/master>`__ there, if
you're ever so inclined.

--------------

Second thought about git, is about `github <http://www.github.com>`__.
The truth is that I don't use it that much: I can host my own git
repositories, I've not yet gotten to a point where I'm working on things
that I might publish things with git. But, it's not hard to notice the
impact that git hub is having on development communities and code. I
think there's clearly some research that's needed on the topic, but
something is changing as a result of this site. Thoughts, in no
particular order:

- There are, I think, legitimate, concerns about the openness of github
  itself. Why are we trusting our open source projects to hosting that
  isn't open? At the same time, the openness of git itself mitigates
  this slightly, as well as the fact that github's business model is
  one of hosting-services rather than one of data lock-in.

- The fact that there isn't a bug-tracker built in means that people
  with a problem are, I think more likely to look for the bugs in the
  code and hack on problems them-self rather than simply provide bug
  reports and feature requests. Not that bug tracking systems are
  problematic, but I think presenting users with code and the
  opportunity to easily publish their own branches without needing
  permission, increases involvement and connectedness to the code.

- I saw `mojombo <http://www.twitter.com/mojombo>`__ post a link to a
  specific revision of the change-log to a (really awesome) ruby-based
  git library. Really awesome. But the cool thing, I guess, was that
  the link to the code was similar to the way that people post links to
  their latest blog posts. This isn't revolutionary, I suppose, but I
  think that git promotes a different sort of publishing style for
  code, that I think is pretty cool/interesting/important.

- I suspect, though I don't have data to verify this, that github
  promotes people to publish things that would have previously been too
  trivial to publish. Flashbake, as above, people are posting
  repositories of their config files, of the odds and ends scripts that
  they use to make their computing experience easier. These are the
  kinds of things that I don't think people have (very frequently)
  stored in version control, and even less frequently published. The
  fact that both of these things are happening is very cool indeed.

That's all. What are you thinking about?
