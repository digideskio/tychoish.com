*Welcome to Station Keeeping, I have for you, a script I'm calling
"Walking Away," which I'm presenting in two parts, so come back on
thursday for the conclusion of this installment. I'm excited to see what
you think of this format, I quite enjoyed it, and I hope you do too. The
finale will start monday afternoon. Stay tuned! Cheers, tycho*

<h2>

INT. ANOTHER ROUND, The Bar

.. raw:: html

</h2>

<p>

Business is slow, but it is still early in the evening, and the bar
hasn't been open long besides. We can still see rough edges on the
construction. The dust hasn't settled, and some of the molding hasn't
been installed.

.. raw:: html

</p>

<p>

ELI BANNER takes a stool at the middle of the bar as we begin, his
shoulders are tense and it's clear that he's not settling in to this
chair. DAVID CONRAD is working at one end of the bar and CARTER is
working at the other.

I'm on duty.

I'm trusting you on that one.

So do I get to order or are you just going to rehash your old lectures?

<p>

DAVID extends his hands, palm up, as if to say:

.. raw:: html

</p>

<dl><dt class="character">

.. raw:: html

<dd>

Then order.

Can I have two beers. And do you have any chilled? I'm not sure I can
deal with the local brew at room temp.

Your missing out. 'Couldn't deal with your fancy coreside crap at any

A few people sitting nearby laugh, ELI ignores them.

Two? There's only one of you, and my stash of cold drinks isn't in
danger of running out.

You. We're having a drink.

<dd>

I'm working, and besides, you can't order me around, buster.

<dd>

You have staff, we're on the rim, and you are technically a civilian
now.

Watch it.

.. raw:: html

<dl><dt class="character">

</dt>
<dd>

Just come on.

.. raw:: html

</dd></dl>

<p>

DAVID turns to CARTER who is talking to patrons at one corner of the bar
and says:

.. raw:: html

</p>

<dl><dt class="character">

DAVID CONRAD

.. raw:: html

</dt>
<dd>

Could you take care of the bar for a little while?

.. raw:: html

</dd>
<dd class="parenthetical">

(pause)

.. raw:: html

</dd>
<dd>

--and remember what I said about mixing the drinks strong. I don't want
any more accidents in the lifts because you're feeling generous.

.. raw:: html

</dd></dl>

ELI dismounts the stool and walks toward an unoccupied booth along the
far-side of the room. It takes DAVID a moment to walk around the bar but
soon joins him, to take a seat where he can keep an eye on the entire
establishment from his seat.
