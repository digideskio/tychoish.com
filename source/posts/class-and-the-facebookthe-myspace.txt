that's been circulating recently, thanks to one of `Cory Doctorow's

posts <http://www.boingboing.net/2007/06/24/myspace_facebook_mir.html>`__,
about the way that the difference between myspace and facebook mirror
class divides in America. It's an interesting piece, and I think that
it's pretty good. I could quibble if I, like danah, had more time to
come to the right words, but I think it's more important to just list
out some thoughts. I apologize for the rough shape of those thoughts.

Like `Cory <http://www.craphound.net>`__ I'm a big admirer of danah
boyd's work, and while I've been watching and do enjoy her work on
social networking sites on the the internet, I have to say that I've had
some mixed personal feelings about On the one hand she's completely
right: the age divide between My-Space and Face-book is class
reinforced/based; but at the same time, I think the picture is way more
complicated, but this is a situation where I'd *love* to play with the
numbers. Read the
`article <http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/ClassDivisions.html>`__ for
yourself and see what you think. Here are my thoughts:

- I think it's important to acknowledge the way that the marketing
  departments of face-book and my-space and the structure of the sites
  affect the membership. There's something about being *on campus* and
  having a website that reflects and supports that connection that FB
  is built around. I have a *crap ton* of face-book friends (600?) but
  I'd say that the vast vast majority of people who I've at least had a
  conversation with or a class, or *something.* There are exceptions,
  of course. I have far fewer contacts on my-space, and while a certain
  number of them are people I know in real life, I think of MS as being
  for really random people I don't know and FB as being for people I
  know. Mind you I have variations on the same profile, but that's a
  testament to laziness.

  Back to my original point, which is that Facebook as a company has
  been able to be successful, interestingly by being exclusive, and
  limiting its membership in various ways. Interestingly the knitting
  social networking site `ravelry.com <http://www.ravelry.com/>`__ is
  doing the same thing, intentionally or not. And I think the
  implications of this practice have a constructive effect on the
  community.

- I think this officially makes me no longer a participant of "youth
  culture," because my main thought about MS is "g-d it's ugly, and
  poorly organized." I think though, that the lack of structure on
  MySpace makes it easier to to "see" the "subalteran," where FBs
  conformity and universality on college campus' makes it hard to see
  these variations.

  On a technical note, as a college facebook member from before the HS
  networks were added, I'm not sure that college students got the
  opportunity to invite/seed HS networks, and I know that I can't
  access my the network for my HS.

- As I read this, I thought about the way that outside of fiction
  cyberpunk has never really happened, because the punks have never
  gotten in (a large way) to the internet/cyberspace, in the way that a
  cyberpunk movement would expect/need. I'm not sure where this train
  of thought ends, but I think looking at the *subalteran* in virtual
  space, and drawing conclusions about these groups, is a hard project.

- I'd be interested in seeing what kind of analysis in a similar vein
  could be made of `LiveJournal <http://www.livejournal.com>`__. I've
  always seen LJ as a sort of microcosm of the internet, but I think in
  terms of "places for sub-culture," that's an interesting way to look
  at these issues.

What are your thoughts?
