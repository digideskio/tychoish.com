tealart redesign

I guess, in retrospect, I've been working on this redesign of tealart
for a few days, but I have it the final push tonight, and I'd like to
present you with a completely overhauled, and completely original [1]_
`TealArt <http://tychoish.com>`__. It's pretty nifty.

I'd like to hear what you all think. It's a very simple design, and it
doesn't have any fancy web 2.0 crap stuff happening, which think is just
as well. It's all CSS and XHTML.

My biggest concern is that there's too much happening, and that there's
not enough whitespace. My second biggest concern is that people won't
see the mono-spaced font for the comforting kitsch that I see in it.

.. [1] In so far as I hand coded everything more or less by hand in a
   text editor, rather than tweaking an existing template. I'm pleased
   with the result.
