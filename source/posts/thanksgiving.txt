So today is a writing day, because, I say so. Though given how closely
the 10th of December is coming (and my first graduate application due
date), I will admit and allow that I might not get to spend the whole
day writing what I want to write.

This is something worth being thankful for, I think. In honor of this,
I'll have good content up here that's writing related, today I think.
There should be enough stuff running through my head to keep us both
entertained.

I'm in the middle of writing a pretty quick scene that leads directly
into the main story of the next chapter or so. My very modest goal is to
finish this chapter and get a start on the second chapter. I'd also like
to start on my statement for grad school: this is the hardest part, and
I need to just suck it up and write it. Alas.

In terms of knitting, I think I'm basically to the cuff of one of the
sleeves, and it's been under a week since I started it, so that means,
likely in about a week, I'm going to have no (0) sleeves to knit.
Amazing really.

I/we don't have thanksgiving plans, it's a nice long weekend but, my
general response is pretty "*meh*\ " to the whole ordeal. The last two
years R. and I, being the last people left on campus, went out for
Indian food, which in retrospect sounds like a confused gesture of
resistance but I assure it was just rather nice. This year, I think
we're going to have fish.

Sounds pretty good to me. Just saying.
