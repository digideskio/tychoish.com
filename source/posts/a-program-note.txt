A Program Note

I just wanted to post a little note.

First of all I want to thank you all for the birthday notes. It's great
to hear from you, and it was great to hear from so many of you. Thanks.

I'm out of town, and likely completely out of touch starting tomorrow
morning blindingly early until Monday afternoon/evening. I'll be `at
this <http://s196623464.onlinehome.us/>`__, and it's an event that I
never take a computer to, so I won't have anything meaningful to say to
you until then.

I'll probably be harping on this for a while, but I put out a call on
the twitter (with an offer of a beer, in compensation) for "Virginia
Woolf Steampunk" stories. This is either for deritive Woolf fiction with
a steam punk flare; or with better luck, Woolf as the heroine of a
steampunk story. My friend `Sam Tung <http://www.quilllabyrinth.com/>`__
posted the first, on facebook, I think though it was close, but `Miss
Violet <http://www.twitter.com/missviolet>`__ had a good one as well.

I'd love to hear more of these stories folks... Keep them coming. Maybe
we can do a collection?

Anyway... Have a good memorial day, and even though I plan to have a
blast at my thing, I'll confess to being a little jealous of the folks
who are going to WisCon and Balticon. Enjoy, and I want full reports
folks.
