vim with your thumbs!

News flash it turns out that the `n800 does have
VIM <http://tychoish.com/posts/new-computer/>`__. And nano, if you
want it. Frankly, I think that's pretty darn swell, and I think running
nano with your thumbs would be a lot easier and more desireable than
learning vim, though I could see the appeal, if you had

I wonder, though if you can do subversion checkouts through it, and thus
use subversion as a synch tool. I mean who needs to wait for .mac
integration when you can cook up some simple shell scripts?

I like the idea that `jeff
suggests <http://www.jeffkirvin.net/2007/09/03/coffee-and-waffles/>`__
where through bluetooth and a portable keyboard you can sort of force
the internal editor to turn off. Now I do this with my laptop, more or
less all the time, so it's not a big concern for me, and I can imagine
in a situation like this VIM wouldn't be the tool you wanted, but none
the less, having this kind of capability in a mobile device would be
simply killer.

I think the new `iPod
Touch <http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/05/ipod-touch-gets-official/>`__
is a great piece of technology, and while I don't really see a need for
anything new in terms of a music player until I outgrow my current ipod,
which will take a while. Having said that, `buddy
dave/will <http://www.soliloqueer.com>`__ suggests that apple will come
out with some sort of tablet in the next year. Which makes sense,
they're so close, and they could totally pull that off, in terms of
technology, and I think there's demand, and for many of the same reasons
that the n800 appeals, that appeals more.

Full sized touch screen keyboard on a tablet? With the ability to use
TextMate and TextExpander? Anyone? I think the kicker would be if it
were all flash based, think they could probably get about 40 gigs for
something reasonable in the next year, which would be plenty for
something like that, if production isn't a problem.

Anyway, enough geek fantasy for right now, I'm going to get some fiction
writing of my own done before I have to do real work. And drink tea,
must remember to drink tea.

Have a good day, I'm sure I'll stay in touch. :)
