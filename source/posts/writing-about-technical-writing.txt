Writing about Technical Writing

I posted something new to Critical Futures today. It's a piece about
technical writing, as part of the latest installment in which has become
something of a `series on technical
writing <http://criticalfutures.com/archive/technical-writing/>`__.

I've been playing, and watching this new tool, called
`dexy <http://dexy.it>`__, which is really cool in its own right, but is
also really cool insofar as it says: technical writing, documentation,
is important and deserves *great* documentation tooling.

For those of you who don't write documentation and who aren't very
involved in the mechanics of publishing lots of text to websites
probably don't find this very exciting. But it is.

In any case, in recognition of the fact that this is now a *theme* in my
blogging and writing, I've created a manually generated archive for this
"series" of posts. See: Posts about `technical writing at Critical
Futures <http://criticalfutres.com/archive/technical-writing/>`__.

There are some other modifications that I've made, and am making to
Critical Futures. Namely: the `archives <http://criticalfutures.com/>`__
page now displays a full list of all the content on the site. Hopefully
this will help Google find older posts, and make them more accessible.
Despite how I feel about these old posts, I think it's good to prevent
them from falling into oblivion too soon.

More changes to come soon, of course. Also real content? Hopefully!

Now: off to sing sacred harp and eat dinner with friends!
