As those of you who microblog may have noticed (or were there) I
attended and went to a cool little `bar camp <http://www.barcamp.org>`__
last weekend. It was a small affair in Central Illinois (I also visited
friends, which was amazing.) but there were some cool freelancers, and
some folks from NCSA, and I think we all learned something from the
encounter. Good times.

Since I got back, however, I've had a serious case of the stupids. I
don't mean to make an excuse for my lack of productivity. I sat down, I
did things that were on my todo-list, I made progress, but I feel like
my brain rotted out for a little while there. It's a strange feeling. In
any case, I spent some time on Wednesday afternoon pulling together
notes, thinking about things, and writing some stuff. Anyway, the brain
seems to have un-rotted. Here's a brief list of the things that are on
my list of things to write about for you soon.

- Oracle's Purchase of Sun Microsystems

- Co-op business models, and Open Source

  This marks a revival of some of my thinking and writing about economic
  issues. I've been thinking about (and the Sun/Oracle deal brought this
  to the surface) about how competition works (or is irrelevant) in
  cooperative business, what role open source and free software plays in
  technological development

- `Jekyll <http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/>`__.

  I sort of assumed that after I made the switch to this new content
  management system that all the people who were interested in it already
  knew about it. Not so apparently. I need to talk more about this.

- I upgraded to Jaunty.

  ...and changed a few things in my system configuration that make it a
  bunch more lightweight. Still on ubuntu.

  I also need to do some more hacking about on things.

- I should cover other topics that I've touched on in the past that
  I've continued to think about, but not continued to write about.
  Things like `git <http://www.git-scm.org>`__,
  `Awesome <http://awesome.naquadah.org>`__,
  `org-mode <http://orgmode.org>`__, my knitting.
