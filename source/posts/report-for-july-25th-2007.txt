report for july 25th 2007

here's some things I got done:

- wrote a bunch of essays for this site
- processed my inbox and wrote a crap ton of essays emails
- did some *`station keeping <http://tychoish.com/hanm>`__* planning
and "research."
- culled my list of feeds to read. from 520ish to 290 ish.
- wrote and posted a tealart entry.
- fiddled with a computer maintenance project, that is taking forever.
one day I'm going to write about my frustrations with the *other
computer platform*.

all in all I think I did pretty good, particularly given my list of
things from yesterday, and shhh, but I'm going to take a shower and try
and get some tealart writing done. If I can pull together a couple more
things, I'll be set for a while, and I'll be able to concentrate on
other projects for the evenings the rest of the week. We'll remember
that I have a crap ton of knitting that I didn't really get done today
to finish.

And shit, it's almost july which means I need to get myself into some
serious GRE and grad school prep. Aside from the GRE, though, I'm not
really worried about things this time around, I think because it's
rational to be worried about the GRE in a way that the other stuff just
doesn't seem so scary.

sigh, angst later, writing now.
