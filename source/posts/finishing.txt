I--after 3 hours of binding off a hem--am done with the knitting of the
Turkish tile sweater. I've even sown up the hem across the back of the
neck and the bottom edge (probably a large share of the sewing). This
means that the sweater is almost done. Almost.

While there are ways to knit hems into sweaters "as you go," to avoid
massive amounts of sewing later, I've found that the end result is
slightly less desirable. At least as far as I've been able to accomplish
it. So I don't mind this sweater.

I steamed the sweater a bit last night before going to bed, and I think
this has helped my opinion of the sweater a great deal. It's still not
perfect, but I hope that by sewing down the hem I'll start to feel
better about the sweater. Here are my concerns:

- It's a cardigan and I always screw up cardigans. they never seem to
  hang right somehow.

- ...this is compounded by the fact that I don't really think I look
  good in cardigans, and don't have a real objection to pullovers.

- The back of the neck is shaped too low, and the shoulder
  shaping--that I felt very proud of when I was doing it--aggravates
  this problem.

I think I have about two hours of sewing up left to do, and I want to
sew clasps on, before I have time to doubt myself in this regard. I'm
also thinking of adding a hood to this sweater, which might help correct
this issue.

That's all for now. You know the drill.
