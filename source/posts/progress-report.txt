**On Blogging about Interesting Things**

`Merlin Mann <http://www.merlinman.com/>`__ posted this thing on his
site,
`43Folders <http://www.43folders.com/2008/09/10/time-attention-creative-work>`__
a few days ago in his ongoing series about his blog's midlife crisis
(which apparently happens after four years.) Merlin's disgusted with the
"blogging to get attention," and the sort of
*digerati*/`problogger <http://www.problogger.com/>`__ blogging tone
that the form has taken in the last 5 years or so. His solution, more or
less, is more along the lines of my own recent transition in my own
blogging, which as basically been to turn tychoish into a ongoing
monologue about the things I'm interested in, and less of a monologue
about me.

Now there are exceptions to this, hence the
`coda <http://tychoish.com/#coda>`__ blog, but for the most part this
has kept me thinking and working, and processing things out there in the
world. When I need to process about myself, I have friends and family.
The end result: good things, and I look forward to what Merlin comes up
with in the future. On tychoish, you can mostly expect me to talk about
the same old things: open source software, trends in computer usage,
amazing knitting things, with the appropriate dash of literary
criticism, and historical doodad. My triad of fair-game topics are still
"technology, science fiction, and knitting" but I'm being a little
firmer in how I police that boundary.

Having said that.... Here's some introspective shit that's been piling
up on my list of things to blog about, I figure if I have to blog about
it, I might as well put it in one place:

1. I--or my alter-ego, depending on how you look at it--have started a
new job this week. if you'd told me about when I graduated from
college, I would have laughed at you, but a lot as changed in these
past year, and it's incredibly awesome and pushes me in a direction
which I'm really eager to travel in.

2. I've started writing a new novel. It's a great concept, the
characters are fun to write and almost instantly came into themselves
which is incredibly good. I finished the first chapter, and I started
the second after taking a day off, and I'm making good progress, and
it's not like pulling teeth, at all. I like that this happens right
after I have a bad couple of weeks where words come very difficultly,
something snaps into place and things just work.

3. I got a new desk chair. This is a very very good thing. I am long
torso-ed and finding suitable chairs is difficult.

4. I gotta make time for knitting.

5. The story I'm posting tomorrow on `Critical
Futures <http://criticalfutures.com>`__ **isn't** written by me. How
cool is that?

Also I've noticed that these coda posts, which were supposed to be short
and effemeral, have been anything but. Gotta work on that.
