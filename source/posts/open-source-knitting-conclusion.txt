Open Source Knitting Conclusion

I posted earlier today, a copy of the last installment of the Open
Source Knitting. It answers some of the preliminary "how" questions that
I think the rest of the series avoided.

While I think the project is still very much "alive," and holds a place
in my mind/mental energy, I think it also is something that I want to do
right, and I'm going to wait till I have time time and some more of the
planning worked out right. I think a huge part of this, interestingly
enough depends on having the community at Ravelry be sufficiently large
and open to all. I say ravlery because it is centralized and it is not
niche, not because of any particular dependency there. I also need to be
a little bit better about being on IRC I think...

Anyway, back to the grindstone.
