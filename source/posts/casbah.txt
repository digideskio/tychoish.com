So, I'm really bad at this whole "posting pictures" part of blogging. I
don't have a good excuse, thought I will admit that if there was a good
way to manage the Wordpress uploads via XML-RPC, in a standard easy to
manage sort of way. Actually, if someone could give me a more clear way
of naming and organizing pictures on the server, with points for the
fewest steps, and/or greatest automation. Anyway, I've gotten off my
duff and I'm ready to actually post some pictures.

These are all on my `flickr <http://flickr.com/photos/27647132@N00/>`__
and of course also on `Ravelry <http://www.ravelry.com>`__, where I'm,
not surprisingly known as tychoish. Today, we're going to get pictures
of the Morocco sweater in it's current state. (Hence the title of the
post). Lets remember that the name "Morocco" is a sort of inside joke,
because although it looks Moorish, the pattern is taken from a Latvian
weaving pattern. The design is from Joyce William's *Latvian Dreams*,
though I must admit that I have not yet really read the pattern, so much
as copied the chart and inspected the picture in the book closely. I
seem to enjoy it better that way.

Here's a good picture of the bottom rear of the sweater. Note that the
ugly green yarn and the curling will be gone when the sweater's finished
as I intend to undo the provisional cast on and knit a turned hem. I've
even bought a 60" Size 0 needle:

(It's a jacket/cardigan, so the middle front is obstructed at the
moment.) Here's a closer view of the back of the sweater in total. It's
about 30-32" long from shoulder to lower edge.

You can probably see from that, how the sleeve's are set it, and the
armholes are shaped. I'm not doing it in one piece, but it's cool none
the less. Look at this:

I picked up stitches holding two colors, continuing the patterns on
their sides. Also the shaping is occurring the top/sides of the sleeves
rather than at the bottom. Here's a better shot of this from the top.

I'm probably most proud of this. Look how the patterns meat from the
shoulder. You can see the "seam," and I think the half stitch
discrepancy that grafting would have provided wouldn't have been
preferable in this situation. It looks good and it'll look better when
it's blocked. Also the way it shifts direction without much fuss is
pretty cool as well.

But as you can see I have a lot to go on this sleeve. Better get to it!

Onward and Upward!
