Empty Tea Bags

I was able to procure empty teabags today at a very swanky kitchen
store. I went with my father to pick up an
`Areopress <http://www.coffeegeek.com/forums/worldregional/uscentral/280102>`__
for my mother, after I saw the
`recommendation <http://tv.boingboing.net/2007/10/17/coffee-with-markfoxi.html>`__
on `Boing Boing TV <http://tv.boingboing.net/>`__. Now I know what
you're thinking, "Why *tycho*, in the world would you want empty
teabags, and the answer is that I want to be able to make loose leaf
tea, but I find most of the methods around to accomplish this are
somewhat flawed. I've never had a tea ball *not* explode mid use, and I
prefer to not be platform dependent (that is, I don't want to have to
brew tea in a particular pot, because it's the only one that will make
the tea.) Anyway. Now all I need to do is buy some tea of this variety.

I have not woven in the ends or blocked the sweater yet, though I am for
the first time all day in the same room with both the sewing up needles
and the sweater so it might happen now. What I thought was going to be a
short in and out sort of day, somehow turned into errands and doodling
about. I hate days where, at the ned you wonder, "what the hell did I do
today."

In that vein, the Morris team is set to do it's usual Halloween hurrah.
It should be fun, but it can be a tedious sort of engagement. I have not
ironed my white shirt, and I don't intend to. It'll be dark, and if you
can see the wrinkles in my shirt, you're missing the point.

Onword and upword!
