- `Agile Authoring: Collaborative Writing with
SVN <http://www.ics.mq.edu.au/~alexei/agile_authoring/#conflicts>`__
It's a good introduction to SVN that I think I'll probably pass on to
the first person that wants to write a paper with me. Also, it has
the most clear description of how merging/conflict resolution
happens. I think if I were collaborating with people and I'd want to
use git, though.
- `unphotographable <http://www.unphotographable.com/>`__ There's
something about this site, pictures that didn't get taken are
described in 150-300 words, that strikes me as so very *Internet
circa late 1990s* in an endearing sort of way. Poet friends might be
entertained or horrified. Cant decide which.
- `feminist sf blog <http://blogs.feministsf.net/>`__ - I'm going to
start blogging every now and then to this group blog on feminist
science fiction. I've been reading it for many many months, and I
really like what this blog does, and I'm looking forward to
contributing. It also means that that I won't post quite so
obsessively here, but then you never know.
- `tealArt micro <http://tychoish.com/micro/>`__ - the microblogging
thing that I wrote about a few days ago, is almost ironed out for
prime time in the new system. Now I just need to get the rest of the
site setup.

**Late Breaking news**: Positive feedback from a graduate school program
that I'm pretty excited about. Nothing definitive. More news as it
develops (slowly.)
