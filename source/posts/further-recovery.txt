I have returned from a really quite amazing morris dance ale, that is an
annual gathering of morris dancers that I've been going to every year
for the past 7 years. Wow.

I think I survived this one in better shape that I have the past few
ones. I'm in slightly better shape. I'm utterly comfortable in these
situations. The organization of the event was a) not my responsibility,
and b) amazing. Everything worked and worked perfectly, and I had a
*blast*.

Having said that, I don't have much of a voice left from too much
singing, but also probably most importantly calling dances, and I have a
bum knee. [1]_

I also have a lot of really great stories, snippets, and memories that I
want to collect in a longer post, as I remember and collect them. Keep
your eyes peeled.

I also got a call back about what would be an *ideal* job. Day long
interview next week. Rock. More details as they prevail. I've got slacks
and a good jacket. I'm debating a tie. This would be really good.

Stay tuned. Regular posting resumes soon.

In an effort to spare some of the details, we were practicing last
wednesday and another dancer dogged left as I was trying to pass her
by the left. End I fell on my knee. It didn't hurt too bad at the
time, and was just a nag by friday. I mostly danced without knee
braces this year--which I attribute to newer shoes and orthotics--but
this injury related issue continues to linger, of course complicated
by the many hours of exuberant dancing. But I'm icing and wearing a
knee brace and I think in a few days it should be healed.
