Acorn: Image Editing for the New World
======================================

`Flying Meat Software <http://flyingmeat.com/>`__ has released a new
program called `Acorn <http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/>`__ that is a
great little image editor program.

It's still 1.0, so it's not *perfect*, but it's damn nice. I played
around for like 10 seconds, and decided that it basically did everything
that I ever did with photoshop, ever. Everything. And it's easier to
use. How cool is that.

This provoked me to say a few things in a chat with `a
friend <http://www.soliloqueer.com/>`__ that I thought would be good to
log here:

- The one thing that big conventional image editing and design suits
  have that I don't think is replicated well in this space is proper
  layout tools. Still have to go to adobe or quark for layout.

- The photoshop interface is really out dated an inefficient, and
  almost works better on windows, because the "window as container
  metaphor" is helpful in unifying everything.

- Photoshop is bloated as hell, because adobe seems more concerned with
  maintaining backwards compatibility than actually moving forward in
  terms of features or actual performance. I think Microsoft did the
  right thing by releasing a document converter, when they changed
  their formats, and I think this is probably the best way to deal the
  compatibility issues (well other than using really good open formats,
  but realistically even good open formats change).
