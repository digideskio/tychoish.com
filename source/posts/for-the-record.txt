I'm breaking the rule of one subject per post a bit, but I have a few
things to point out:

On Friday, 8 July 2005, I posted three times. Now in fairness, one of
these posts was before I went to bed on thursday in the wee hours of
Friday Morning, nevertheless it is important to note that the world did
don't come to an end.

I finished the sweater I was working on. The wonky dye-lot didn't seem
to affect it terribly, but I'm still going to have to have a word with
the maker because it's sort of inexcusable to buy 5 skeins of the same
dye lot and find them radically different from each other half way
through the body of a sweater. I'll report more on this in a bit. I'm
going to write up the pattern so there will be notes.

I decided on the Webs option for the yarn. It seems webs is having a
sale now, so most of the yarn I want was marked NFD (no further
discount) and was therefore not subject to the "orders over 60 USD get
an automatic 20% off). This didn't deter me from getting several
projects of yarn.

I have started to knit socks while I wait for this yarn to come in. Wow.
I like making socks, it's just, I think I need to stick to worsted
weight socks from here on out, because the fingering and sport ones are
just too much for me.

I think I've figured out a way to knit set-in sleeves as in the EPS
seamless yoke manner. News forthcoming.

Yes I am obsessed with knitting. No it isn't all I think about. Yes I
may in-fact post about something else one of these days.

Thats all folks.
