New feature, I guess. I got a knitting question on ravelry, and I'm
going to answer it here. I'll answer your knitting question as well if
you send them to me on ravelry, or by email at garen@tychoish.com.

I have been looking around on Raverly for a while now trying to find
an alternative to the Jaimeson Shetland wool. I am going to be
making a Fair Isle EZ cardigan but cant tolerate 100% wool. Do you
happen to know the name(s) of other yarn that may be a good
alternative?

I'd like to make a few of comments in response. First. There's something
special about Shetland wool. It's not, *soft*, but there's something
about the wool that makes it much more tolerable, and I'm convinced that
it has magical properties. Something about the crimp of the wool, and
the way it's spun (woolen, so that it's airy.) I encourage everyone to
knit something with real Shetland (Jamisons, Harrisville, Etc.) because
it's amazing, and you might find that you can stand it.

The second "try wool solutions anyway," answer is to experiment with
some solutions that might make the wool more bearable. I'm a bit
sensitive to wool, but I think I cope with it fairly well, and there are
things you can do to make a sweater "easier" to wear. For instance,
having a sweater with an open (plackets) or v-neck keeps the fabric of
the sweater off your skin where it is the most sensitive. Secondly you
can knit turned hems out of something that you're not sensitive too:
alpaca, cotton, silk. This keeps the wool away from any place that
matters while letting you still knit with wool. You can go all out here,
as hems don't take very much yarn and you generally want to knit a hem
out of a very light weight yarn. How to knit a hem is, however another
question entirely. I find silk and wool blends to be the way to go in
this direction.

As for specific yarn suggestions? There aren't a lot of options, and if
you're price sensitive (as I often am) there are fewer options. One of
the key problems, is that Fair Isle-style sweaters really ought to be
knit out of light weight yarn (sport weight or less, but not lace
weight), and there aren't a lot of options here. There are a few silk
and wool blends, a few wool/tencel blend (mostly sock yarns), and there
is of course cotton (which can be used, though that doesn't strike me as
fun). I think Beroco makes their ultra alpaca in a sport/light weight
that might be fun for your purposes, but alpaca is much warmer than wool
which isn't always a good thing.

That's about all I have. Anyone else? Send more questions `my
