I have a confession. I last week (briefly) considered getting a Nokia
N810 so that I could sync and use `org-mode <http://www.orgmode.org>`__
when I was away from my computer/laptop. The N800/810 is a small tablet
that runs a Debian based operating system, which means it could run
emacs, and I could write little clickable scripts that could do all of
the syncing and awesomeness that I've grown accustomed to.

Then I realized how absurd this is, and cast it aside. My laptop is
really mobile, and if I needed it to be lighter *or* more mobile, I
could buy a new battery for it. And it has a full sized keyboard.

This is a sickness right?
