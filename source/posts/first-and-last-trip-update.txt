So. There's an ice storm. And there aren't flights going out of the
airport, on any airline, that could get me where I want to go before
mid-Saturday morning. Which would defeat the whole purpose of going.
Given that I leave Saturday evening.

So here I am. What can be done over the phone will be, and everyone
seems pretty encouraging, so I'm not terribly distraught over this.

Anyway, Here's my post from this morning/afternoon as I was sitting at
the gate waiting for the plane to *not show up!*

Hey friends in blogland. (This is being posted after words, when free
Internet is available.)

Expect many short updates as I have time.

I have arrived at the gate, and security was a huge non issue. No one
balked at my fountain pen, which I wasn't really expecting anyway. It
took all of 30 minutes from dropping off-to the gate, including a
bathroom break and walk. Not bad.

I was however, on the verge of vomiting as we neared the airport. Now
that all of the annoying airport things are coped with I'm ok. I do sort
of wish that I had a longer battery leash. There's a guy hogging the
plug next to me. Sigh.

In my *must occupy myself* mood earlier I tracked down a video of `danah
boyd <http://www.zephoria.com>`__ speaking on you tube. Here it is:

I really like her and what she has to say, and I think in a lot of
interesting ways, we over lap, or will, assuming the next few days goes
over well. Which it will.

I'm going to go listen to `escape pod <http://www.escapepod.org>`__ and
tor podcasts and have fun with that. Save the battery for when it really
matters.

Warmest regards,

tycho

(Onward and Upward!--literally ;))
