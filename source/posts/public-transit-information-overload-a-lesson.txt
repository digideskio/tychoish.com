Public Transit Information Overload: A Lesson
=============================================

Philadelphia is replacing, or at least promising to replace, the trains
that run the commuter rail system. The new trains are 35-40 years newer
than the usual fair, and are replete with "new technologies," one of
which is an automated (I believe GPS-based) announcement system, which
figures out what station is next, and which line you're on. This is
great in theory, but there's a problem.

This system gives you too much information. Trains in Philly are named
by their terminus, and all trains converge (and pass through) downtown.
There's history here which makes things a bit easier to understand if
you're a transit geek, but after every stop--\ **including outlying
stops**--the train tells you what line you're on, and which stops it
makes or skips. The problems:

- At most outlying stations, you can tell by the station you're at,
  which line you're on. It's sometimes useful to know where the train
  you're on is headed, but the trains only tell you that on the
  *outside* of the train, until you get downtown, when the
  announcements change from "where you've been," to "where you're
  going."

- The "this is the train you're on," announcements don't change as you
  pass stops, so you hear where the train's been at every stop *after*
  even you passed the relevant stops. The announcements make sense, as
  there are 5 or six "main line" stops that some trains stop on, and
  others don't, so as you're heading *towards* doubtful stops, it's
  useful information, when you're passed them: less so.

- All announcements are displayed on screens in written form and read
  by a speech synthesizer. I understand the accessibility concerns, but
  there are still conductors and I'm not sure that the information is
  presented in a way that is usable by people who don't already have a
  significant understanding of the transit system.

--------------

Given this background, as a technical writer, and someone who geeks out
on information presentation, I felt that there are a number of things
that can be learned from this case:

- More information is sometimes confusing, and can make concepts harder
  to grasp.

- Figuring out what people need to know in any given situation is more
  important (and more difficult) than figuring out what is true or
  correct.

- Sometimes multi-modal presentation may not actually add value in
  proportion with the amount of annoyance it generates.

- Presentation matters. The speech synthesizer does not sound very good
  *and* it's inefficient.
