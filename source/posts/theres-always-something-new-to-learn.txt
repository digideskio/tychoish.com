There's Always Something New to Learn

Now that I'm fairly confident in my ability to do basic Linux systems
administration tasks: manage web and email servers, maintain most Linux
systems, convince desktop systems that they really *do* want to work the
way they're supposed to, I'm embarking on a new learning process. I've
been playing around with "real" virtualization on my desktop, and I've
been reading a bunch about systems administration topics that are
generally beyond the scope of what I've dealt with until now. Here is a
selection of the projects I'm playing with:

- Getting a working xen setup at home. This requires, learning a bit
more about building working operating systems, and also in the not to
distant future buying a new (server) computer.

- Installing xen on the laptop, because it'll support it, I have the
resources to make it go, and it'll be awesome.

- Learning everything I can about LVM, which is a new (to me) way of
managing partitions and disk images, that makes backups, disk
snapshots, and other awesomeness much easier. It means, some system
migration stuff that I have yet to tinker with, as none of my systems
currently support LVM.

- Doing package development for Arch Linux, because I think that's
probably within the scope of my ability, because I think it would add
to my skill set, and because I appreciate the community, and I want
to be able to give back. Also I should spend some time editing the
wiki, because I'm really lazy with that.

I guess the overriding lesson of all these projects is a more firm grasp
of how incredibly awesome, powerful, and frankly *stable* Arch Linux is
(or can be.) I mean there are flaws of course, but given how I use
systems, I've yet to run into something show stopping. That's pretty
cool.
