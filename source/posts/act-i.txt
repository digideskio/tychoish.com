Sorry I've been (more) absent these past few days. I remain well.

A lot of my writing time has been going to the novel project. I have a
pretty good story-board level outline of the first act.
`Andy <http://tychoish.com/anduril/>`__ sent me a great link about
`writing narrative computer
games <http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2007/10/08/how_to_write_an_adventure_game/>`__
which I'm going to be reading in more depth as I plan the second part. I
can feel it starting to get together, so that's good. I've talked before
about my trials with
"`research <http://tychoish.com/posts/what-does-research-mean/>`__\ "
in the context of my writing, and I think I'm doing better with this,
and won't bore you with the details.

The funny thing is that I predict that at this pace I might be ready to
start the draft during november, which means despite my crankyness about
`NaNoWriMo <http://www.nanowrimo.org>`__, I might actually start with
the rest of folk around November 1. I have a lot of other projects that
are going to be coming due about that time, so I don't expect that I'll
actually get it done, and wouldn't think of trying, but that's cool.

I also am getting preliminary feedback on the novella. I'm encouraged.

Cheers!
