I've had a nice quiet weekend, the first such weekend in quite a while.
It's nice to be able to relax, work on projects without deadlines, and
avoid all of the [[editing\|the-editing-hole]] that I ought to be doing.

Some notable accomplishments, current projects, and other events in the
last few weeks:

- If you ever visit `tychoish.com <http://tychoish.com>`__ in your web
  browser (as opposed to by way of its aggregation,) you'll note that
  the design has changed somewhat.

  This is the design that I've been using for my personal wiki for months,
  and so I'm quite used to it, but feedback is welcome.

  The design change has inspired a bit of introspection, hence this post,
  and perhaps some of the posts that will follow. Please bear with me.

- Months ago a friend of mine said "some of us might like to know how
  you're doing every now and then, and your blog is just stuff about
  obscure technology."

  Guilty as charged. Recently, I've been much more interested in using
  this blog as a scratch space for projects that I don't have quite enough
  time to pursue in appropriate depth.

  Having said that, I think (or hoped,) that I've calmed down a bit in
  recent months and years: My career/professional identity seems a bit
  more stable. I'm doing a better job at focusing [[big-projects]], which
  means some shorter posts and more personal posts may be in order.

- I got a new computer last week. I'm working on a post that addresses
  this in a bit more depth. In short it's great. So my largely
  unnecessary justification is:

  - A smaller machine, which is better on my back when I am walking
    around.

  - Beefier system, which means I can compile things quicker (and I've
    been doing more of this recently.)

 - The ability to dedicate the older system to some stay at home things:
   having a working desk at home, playing music, running some buildbot
   stuff, and the like.

 I've realized that even though there are little things that I might like
 to change about how my computer works, and things that I'd like to setup
 and get working for the most part, *things just work*. And that's really
 great.

- There's a host of stuff that I'm working on that probably isn't
  apparent to the internet:

  - My day job. I'm doing awesome documentation things for a neat New
    York City database software company/open source project that you've
    probably heard of (if you're into this kind of thing.) It's
    rewarding, interesting, and it means I can spend all most of my time
    day making things.

  - I've been working on submitting documentation patches to a couple of
    open source projects: `buildbot <http://buildbot.org>`__ and
    `MediaGoblin <http://media%20goblin.org/>`__. I need to do more of
    this work.

  - The editing pile. Currently on tap: a mess of blog posts, the
    prologue of my most recently drafted novel, and some of the last
    little pieces of the Cyborg Institute launch. Speaking of which that
    should happen in the next week or so.

  Next up? More of the novel and suggestions from frist readers of the
  systems administration book (see next item.)

- Never to be deterred, I'm hard at work on the outline for another
  novel. The plan is to have something I can start drafting in earnest
  by the end of the summer. I feel pretty good about the project,
  although as I was working on an outline last night, I changed the
  last third of the book. Oops.

- The systems administration book. Available via git today, With
  general release following shortly. All feedback as well as pull or
  merge requests with comments and suggestions are all welcome. See the
  following for git repositories

  - `administration on
    git.cyborginstitute.net <http://git.cyborginstitute.net/?p=administration.git;a=summary>`__

  - `administration on
    github.com <https://github.com/cyborginstitute/administration>`__

  (Both are identical.)

  The `cyborg institute
  listserv <http://lists.cyborginstitute.net/listinfo/institute>`__ would
  be a good place for bug/issue tracking at least for now.

- On the topic of editing, I've recently discovered `the one clause
  per-line <http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/>`__
  formatting style.

I've long attempted to keep lines short to promote cleaner diffs, but in
truth, if you end up reflowing paragraphs, the resulting diffs are
basically useless. I've encountered one-sentence-per-line tactics, which
seems like a good idea, except that sentences often exceed 80
characters.

I'm not yet decided on the subject, especially for writing longer
sections of text, but it does make editing easier.

Onward and Upward!
