lord only knows what was wrong... most of the time our webhost is
amazing, sometimes though, it sucks, and yesterday was a definite case
of the latter triumphing over the former.

TealArt isn't back up, so we're going to be a week behind on Station
Keeping, I guess, but we'll see.

I don't have anything for you today but I posted some neat things
yesterday before the crash that I doubt anyone read, so enjoy yourself,
and thanks for stopping by.

cheers, tycho
