=======================
And Then There Were Six
=======================

I finished the sixth chapter of my novella yesterday. I had a scene that
I planned for the end of the sixth chapter, that I think I need to push
to chapter seven, but even still I think I'm on track. (In truth, there
isn't much in the last chapter, and I think it'll help the pacing to
have the "bang" of the last chapter, happen as the second or third part.
And in truth, I've never quite been neck and neck with the outline. I'm
ok with this.

I'm thinking of starting a counting down "crap-o-meter" on the premise
that everyone has a million words of crap in them. I figure I've
probably at about 120k of fiction by now, and the current project
probably has another 10k in it.

Sigh.
