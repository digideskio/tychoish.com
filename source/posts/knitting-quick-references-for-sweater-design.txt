Knitting Quick References for Sweater Design

I posted about my `academic
contrarianism <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/writing-day-to-day/>`__,
earlier and I think I'd be foolish to claim that this tendency was
limited simply to my academic half (2/3s?). In knitting, this manifests
as a tendency to reject patterns and come up with my own designs, though
you probably wouldn't know it from the designs: they tend to be pretty
normal looking traditional-ish knitting designs. The contrarian comes
out in the process, first by rejecting prepared patterns, but more by
the ass-backwards way that I think about sweater construction. I fear
that this approach appears in the patterns I write.

Now perhaps I give myself too much credit, because it's my sense that
I'm not that atypical amongst designers and other renegade types;
furthermore, I think this approach to knitting is not detrimental, and
actually allows me to make better patterns. So there.

As I was writing the pattern for a sweater that I made this semester as
part of the *project-of-infamy*, I realized that while I could (and did)
go through every little step, in the day to day knitting of this
sweater, which took me 6 weeks, a knitter wouldn't need access to the
entire pattern. At the same time, I tend to think of patterns as having
a number of landmarks, turning points where some sort of change needs to
happen, otherwise there's a lot of just knitting *as you were*.

So I decided in this pattern--which is otherwise pretty complicated--to
write a "Quick Reference Guide" that summerizes all the major turning
points of the sweater in a couple of paragraph. I'm going to reprint it
here for your personal edification, with the hope that you'll be able to
use it as a model to summarize other knitting patterns, or as a blank
slate on which you can develop your own patterns. This is for a
fair-isle stlye/gauge sweater with a crew neck: adjust your numbers and
style appropriately.

Cast on the key number (320), knit a hem (ie. ribbing for 2 inches).
Knit one row plain, (*optional: switch to the larger needle and
increase*), establish patterns and knit for 12-13 inches in pattern.
Begin the gusset, increasing 2 stitches every three rows for 3
inches. Place gusset stitches on holder and start underarm steeks.
Knit 7 inches and begin the front neck shaping and neck steek.
Decrease on either side of the steek every round for 1.5 inches,
then establish the back neck steek and decrease on either side of
the steek every *other* round on either side of both steeks for 1.5
inches. Bind off the shoulders together using the 3 needle method.

Cut the arm hole steeks, and pick up stitches. Establish the
patterns on the next round and decrease on either side of the gusset
for every third round until there are no more gusset stitches left.
Continue decreasing sleeve stitches on every 3rd round until the
sleeve measure half of it's total intended length (aprox. 9-10
inches). Decrease every 4th round for the remaining length of the
sleeve. Knit a round plain in the background color decreasing
radically for a fitted cuff. Knit the cuff for 2 inches, and then
bind off the sleeve, and repeat the process for the second sleeve.
Cut open the neck steek, pick up stitches around the neck opening
and knit a collar in corrugated ribbing for 1.5 inches. Maintain the
front neck steek for the plackets. Bind off the collar, cut open the
neck front steek and pick up stitches around the placket edge
independently. Knit each placket and a turned hem. Sew down placket
hems and weave in all remaining ends and block the sweater.

I hope the warmer weather in the northern hemisphere is treating you all
well, and not keeping you from knitting too much.

Cheers, tycho
