tycho got new boots today (and inserts, because of his crazy high
arches).

In other news, tycho also sent `the
aforementioned <http://tychoish.com/posts/novella-progress/>`__
novella draft-portion to a couple of readers for initial impressions,
just to make sure that I didn't talk about my feet.

It's a fear I have, you know you spend lots of time writing something
and then you read it six months later, only to discover that you were
writing about your feet the whole time, and didn't notice.

Also, no new headphone cord, I'm thinking about putting a set of noise
canceling bluetooth headphones on my list of crap that I should get at
some later point.

Anyway, I'm going to go shower and try and write some more, because I'm
in a pretty good mood.
