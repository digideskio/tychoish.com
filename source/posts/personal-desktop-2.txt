For a few days last week, in between the time that I wrote the `Personal
Desktop <http://www.tychoish.com/2009/07/personal-desktop>`__ post and
when I posed it yesterday, I had a little personal computing saga:

1. One of my monitors developed a little defect. I'm not sure how to
describe it, but the color depth suffered a bit and there was this
*flicker* and I really noticed it. It's not major and I probably
wouldn't have noticed it, except I look at a very nice screen all day
at work and I had a working display right next to it, I *saw* every
little flicker.

2. I decided to pull the second monitor, and just go back to one
monitor. While I like the "bunches of screens" approach, and think it
has merit, particularly in tiling environments, I also think that I
work pretty well on one screen, and with so many virtual desktops,
it's no great loss. Not being distracted by the flicker is better by
far.

3. I pulled the second monitor and *bam!* the computer wouldn't come
back from the reboot. Shit. No error beeps, nothing past the bios
splash screen. No USB support. Everything plugged in. Shit.

4. I let things sit for a few days. I was slamed with stuff in other
areas of my life, and I *just couldn't cope with this*. It doesn't
help that I really like to avoid messing with hardware if I can at
all help it. Fellow geeks are big on building custom hardware, but
the truth is that my needs are pretty minimal and I'd rather leave it
up the to the pros.

5. On Friday, I sat down with it, pulled the video card that I'd put in
it when I got the machine (an old nvidia 7200 series), and I
unplugged the hard drives and futzed with the ram, and after
re-seating the RAM it worked. I'm not complaining, and I figure it
was just some sort of fluke as I jostled the case.

6. So now I'm back, with one monitor, no other problems have been fixed
from the last post, but I can live with that.

--------------

As I was fretting with the implications of having a computer die on me
like this, and thinking about my future computing trajectory. I realized
that my current set up was deployed (as it were) under a number of
different assumptions about the way I use computers. I got the desktop
with the extra monitors when I was starting a series of remote jobs and
needed more resources than I could really expect from my previous setup
(a single macbook.) I also, in light of this downgraded my laptop to
something smaller and portable that was good for short term tasks, and
adding mobility to my setup, but that really didn't work as my only
computer for more than a day or two.

Now things look different. I'm not doing the same kind of remote work
that I got the desktop for, and I have a killer machine at work that I'm
only using a portion of (in a VM, no less). I have a VPS server "in the
cloud" that hosts a lot of the "always on" infrastructural tasks that I
needed from my desktop when I first got it.

I'm not sure what the solution is. Make the desktop at home more
"server-y" (media files, downloading stuff + writing) exchange the
laptop at some point for: a 15" notebook that would be my primary
machine--particularly useful for long weekend trips, un/conferences and
so forth, and some sort of small netbook-class device, for day-to-day
portability.

It's a thought. Anyway, on to more important thoughts.

Cheers!
