An `academic group <http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/pmnstudygroup>`__,
interested in memory and narrative started to write a blog in october,
but hasn't had the follow through that one might hope for. But then it's
an academic blog, and getting academics to collaborate on projects like
this, is terribly difficult. Maybe we'll see some more. I'm pulling out
interesting bits from the intro post, and I'll keep you all posted, if
more interesting things start appearing.

This interesting little bit from the first post. Not so much a summary,
just something that got my eye....

`Introducing the Popular Memory & Narrative Study
Group <http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/pmnstudygroup/entry/introduction_to_popular/#comments>`__:

"...the starting point for sociology, almost by definition, has been
‘society’ and its ‘institutions’; whilst in versions of
structuralist social theory the individual has been something of a
vanishing point, disappearing without trace under a deluge of
language and discourse. Instead, a reinvigorated focus on narrative
begins with individual stories, memories and life-histories and
traces these outwards (and upwards) to the social structures and
collectivities of which individuals are a part."

blog <http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/pmnstudygroup>`__.)

Exactly!
