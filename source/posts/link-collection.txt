I seem to have collected a rather lot of links that I think and hope
you'll find as interesting as I have. (Some of these are old, but still
relevant):

In the vein of my economic/political posts of late, I came across the
`blog of Alexandre Enkerli <http://enkerli.wordpress.com/>`__, a nifty
anthropologist and ethnographer that I found via
`identi.ca <http://identi.ca/enkerli>`__. Who says microblogging doesn't
have value? In anycase I have a couple of links, first `a complaint
against journalism, as a
field <http://enkerli.wordpress.com/2008/11/25/my-problem-with-journalism/>`__,
to which I'm incredibly sympathetic. I should probably write some more
about journalism, both with regards to its social impact, but also about
ongoing collapse of the journalism business. More importantly, however,
Enkerli wrote `an interesting piece about "a global network of city
states" <http://enkerli.wordpress.com/2009/04/14/a-glocal-network-of-city-states/>`__
about government and institutional organization, which I rather liked.
I've been thinking recently about institutions and governance as a part
of the series on co-ops, and I think I'm going to make a foray into
something more governmental here, soon.

Moving on from the economy, a couple of posts from
`futurismic <http://www.futurismic.com>`__ which is one of my favorite
blogs that I don't read enough. It's in the boing-boing vein, but `Paul
Raven <http://www.velcro-city.co.uk/about>`__ is made of awesome, and I
enjoy the niche. In anycase, this is a bit older, and it's `a post
announcing another
post <http://futurismic.com/2009/03/18/rushkoff-on-the-economy-let-it-die/>`__
where `Douglas Rushkoff <http://rushkoff.com/>`__ suggests that the
economy `isn't worth
saving <http://www.arthurmag.com/2009/03/16/let-it-die-rushkoff-on-the-economy/>`__.
And then another from a few days later `about the fantastic nature of
the us
economy <http://futurismic.com/2009/03/26/the-us-economy-is-a-myth/>`__.

I'm not sure how I feel about Rushkoff's theories, and I certainly don't
think he's the theoretical oracle of the networked age, but his thinking
inspires pretty interesting thoughts, even if it's semi-orthogonal. Can
things be semi-orthogonal?

Finally new territory. I've been reading
`ultrasparky <http://www.ultrasparky.org/>`__ since, gosh, 2000 or there
abouts, I think. `Dan (sparky) wrote a post where he contemplated the
recent history of
blogging <http://www.ultrasparky.org/archives/2009/05/crap_rotation.html>`__
and in doing so expressed pretty much exactly how I feel about the
current state of blogging. Read it, it's good stuff.

And, oh look here, `it's a yet another Drupal-based, niche social
networking site targeted at 20 and 30 something
technologist-types <http://www.brazencareerist.com/>`__. You're probably
uninterested, but it's my niche, damnit. Also speaking of my niche,
there's a `new social networking site for gay/queer geeks/nerds, calld
doorq.com <http://www.doorq.com/>`__. For those of you who care, I
suspect it's running on DotNetNuke.

And now for some miscellanea: `mongodb, a database engine that doesn't
have schemeas. like couchdb, only, less
erlang <http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Home>`__. It all depends on
how it gets used, of course, but I think Erlang is a good thing for
couch, but who knows. Also: `a bibliography of academic resources
related to teaching and learning in second
life <http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~mpepper/slbib>`__. And an academic
journal about `information technology, policy, and culture (with an
Australian focus), called fibre culture <http://fibreculture.org/>`__. I
was particularly interested in `this article about Schizoanalysis as
Metamodeling <http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue12/issue12_watson.html>`__,
because I still have a lot of affection for Deleuze and Guatteri and
their theories.

Finally an article, by O'Reily Editor Andy Oram, called `From Open
Source Software to Open Culture: Three
Misunderstandings <http://www.praxagora.com/andyo/article/open_source_open_culture.html>`__.
And then a debate about the `emacswiki <http://www.emacswiki.org>`__.
For background, EmacsWiki is really a working document and a discussion
of different approaches--\ `emacs <http://gnu.org/software/emacs>`__
already has a `good
manual <http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/emacs.html>`__, so the
wiki fills a different niche. The wiki, as a result is very rough,
coverage isn't consistent across areas, some pages are basically
discussions while others are more formal documentation, and the software
is simple while the design is straight from the late 90s. I think it's
brilliant, but `not everyone
agrees <http://xahlee.org/emacs/emacs_wiki_problem.html>`__.

That's all I have right now. Enjoy!
