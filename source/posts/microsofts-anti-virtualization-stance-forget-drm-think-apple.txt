`Microsoft's anti-virtualization stance: forget DRM, think
Apple <http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070624-microsofts-anti-virtualization-stance-forget-drm-think-apple.html>`__:

Microsoft and its advocates have been able to say: "with a PC, you
get the most choice of software and peripherals." Now a case could
be made that the most choice is to be found on a Mac or Linux box
virtualizing Windows on the side. The big impediment to this world
is the cost of Windows, but an OEM price on the low-end of Windows
could eliminate that impediment quickly.

Until Steve Jobs allows the virtualization of the Mac OS, which will
happen precisely never, Microsoft's commodity cash cow could find
itself virtualized into the corner.

(from `Ars Technica <http://arstechnica.com/>`__.)

While there are always a few programs that one might want from the
platform you don't have, I've found that the number of PC programs that
I wish I could run but can't has waned in the past three years (since i
made the switch). So yeah, I think its fair that MS has something to be
afraid of.

Having said that, when I go up to an intel mac, I can't really see
wanting to run windows in VM, ubuntu maybe (but all of the cool linux-y
goodness is something that you more or less get in OS X anyway, so
whatever).
