-  Monday morning, before I left St. Louis, the trash truck or
*something* took out the phone line behind the house. The phone line
which carries the internet. *Sigh*. So while I've been driving and
have been somewhat out of touch, by the nature of this whole process,
the fact that the internet died didn't help things. Sorry for the
lack of posts.

-  The midwest (particular the northern and parts that I'm most
familiar) is, on the whole, incredibly boring to drive through. Not
stunningly boring, but not that bad. By the time you get to eastern
Ohio, however, things start to get interesting. The miles and miles
of corn fields interspersed with the lone standing tree and
occasional soybean crop--you know you're in trouble when soybeans
come as a refreshing change of pace--were replaced with rolling
hills, mountains, and the like.

To make up for this, however, it did seem that they were doing a lot of
construction/road repair for very little improvement. Parts of the
eastern edge of the turnpike were actually pretty good: modern, pretty
wide, in good repair; other parts, not so much.

Although, to be sure, heading east was much better than heading west.
Better to get the bland out of the way first, and have something
interesting at the end.

-  I met `Chris <http://www.cgkreality.com/>`__ for the first time, in
the flesh. Dude. This requires it's own sublist:

1. I think the common perception is that things that happen in meatspace
are somehow more authentic, and meaningful, and "real" than
conversations that happen on line, and often I'd agree. While I'm
certainly not complaining about the real-life experience, I do think
that there are some distinct disadvantages:

-  It's hard to share links in meatspace, and so "hey I was reading
this thing, here's a link, and I thought that it was nifty and has
implications for \_\_\_\_" becomes, not a stepping stone for
another thought, but an exercise in "hell, I read something not
that long ago and thought it seemed relevant.

-  Chris and I tend to have these interleaved conversations where
we'll sort of drift through a few topics at once, and because at
least in an ephemeral sort of way chats are logged, it's hard to
interrupt the other person, even if there are a couple of threads
of quasi-related material on the table at once. Without the
benefit of a running transcript you have to remember more and
that's *weird*, or at least it feels weird in this context. I'll
adjust I'm sure.

2. On the whole, he is (and the occasion was) pretty much what I
expected. I've had this theory about "how people turn out to really
be in reality versus how they seem online," which is that after
enough time (months/years) it's pretty hard to maintain any sort of
ruse or false facade. Sure, people lie, and people lie in real life,
but those amount to little surprises. Big surprises? Unlikely. That
held true.

-  The cats have been reasonably cooperative. They're sort of scared of
the outside, and were made nervous by the whole experience.
Thankfully their response was to cower/sleep in the carrier and not
make a lot of noise. I'm leaving them with M.N. in Philadelphia for a
night or two while I secure digs for us in New Jersey.

-  M.N. and I will have a couple of opportunities this weekend to do
shape note singing. Woot!

-  It's nice to know that summer, even early summer, isn't quite as
brutal everywhere as it is in St. Louis (or the other places where
I've (semi)recently spent my summers: Kansas City, Nashville, and St.
Louis of course.) Between that and the Wisconsin winter tolerance,
which hasn't yet worn off, I think I have a freakishly broad
temperature tolerance.

-  Eastern time is weird. Though, at least for a little while, I like it
because it sort of means that my body doesn't quite get that it's
daylight savings time. And there are very few things that I hate more
than daylight savings time.

And I think, that's all the news that's fit to print.

**Edited to add:** I'm going to continue such musing regarding my
current state over on `my live
journal <http://tychoish.livejournal.com/>`__ which seems the more
appropriate venue for this kind of blathering. Real post tomorrow. I
swear.
