=============================
Primitive Territorial Machine
=============================

Until this point in the series, my titles have been somewhat more...
creative, "primitive territorial machine" is simply the title of the
division of the book that I've selected this weeks' quotes from. This
larger section is about, I think, the development/emergence of "oedipus"
(and capitalism, too I suppose) but really it's all about the
development of culture and civilization. That's my read anyway.

While this isn't exactly chicklit, or all purpose op/ed writing, I think
there's something interesting here, and it's my hope to make this pretty
accessible to everyone. So if something isn't clear, call me on it. If
you want more resources, ask. If you completely disagree with my
interpretation of a quote, I welcome it. My selections only reflect what
catches my eye, and I claim no impartiality.

I ran across this piece on `Lavral
Subjects <http://lavaralsubjects.wordpress.com/>`__ called
"`Schizoanalysis in
Practice <http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2007/06/17/schizoanalysis-in-practice/>`__,"
and I think it is helpful in situating *Anti-Oedipus* in the appropriate
intellectual context.

With all that said on to this week's attempt:

The first quote I have is kind of pithy, but it reiterates a concept
that I talked about
`before <http://tychoish.com/posts/deleuzeian-desiring-machines/>`__:

"..it is *in order to function* that a social machine must *not
function well*" (151).

The idea that functioning is dependent on not-functioning. It's a cheep
shot, but I suspect that we can account some of the enduring popularity
of Freudian theory itself to this basic principal. Somewhat more
seriously, on an ethical level, as Foucault instructs us to read this
book, the theme is about enduring contradiction and all that.

As I wrote the above words, I realize how incredibly pomo and 1990s this
all sounds. Which I suppose is the point. While I still believe it, I
think it's interesting how this sort of sounds dated, or at least tried.

On to less pithy sections:

"The death of a social machine has never been heralded by a
disharmony or a dysfunction; on the contrary, social machines make a
habit of feeding on the contradictions they give rise to, on the
crises they provoke, on the anxieties they engender, and on the
infernal operations they regenerate. Capitalism has learned this,
and has ceased doubting itself, while even socialists have abandoned
the belief in the possibility of capitalism's natural death by
attrition. *No one has ever died from contradictions.* and the more
it schizophrenizes, the better it works, the American way" (151;
emphasis added).

I think this passage speaks for itself, so I won't bother, and I think
this point is well made. I add the emphasis, not because I think it's a
particularly powerful conclusion, or central to the passage, but simply
to highlight the ways that this book can induce a chuckle here and
there.

Lest you think that *AO* is all fun and games, and relatively low on
trips through *psychoanalyic land*, don't be fooled by excerpts, I've
chosen well... So if you get a copy of the book and start following
along with me, don't tell me I didn't warn you.

"...And isn't that also what Oedipus, the fear of incest, is all
about: the fear of a decoded flow... It is the thing, the unnamable,
the generalized decoding of flows that reveals up *a contrario* the
secret of all these formations, coding the flows, and even
overcoding them, rather than letting anything escape coding" (153).

I talked about this passage a few weeks ago, and after I had prattled on
about "flows" and "decoding" for a few minutes I paused to take a sip of
water, and promptly realized how absurd it all sounded. At the same
time, while I'm convinced, I'm not sure how directly applicable I can
make this out to be, and that was my initial goal of these essays. I
think that it speaks to our propensity to make meaning, to over explain
coincidence, and to construct representational models based on
insufficient data. In away they sort of say that Oedipus is about
needing a good story to explain this disorganized "*schizoid*\ " series
of events and situations.

That's my gloss anyway, what's yours?

Cheers, tycho
