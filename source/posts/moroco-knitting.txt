The piece I'm knitting is probably about 8.5 inches long now, and I have
about 5 more rows to knit, except that I have made an error in two of
those five rows, and have to do some un-knitting. Sigh.

It's mostly that I got carried away and forgot to read the chart. After
the 5 rows, I have the body of the sweater to knit, which I do hope will
fly by really quick on up to the underarms at which point it gets
interesting again... in the good way. It's going to be a long
coat/jacket type thing. I'll take a picture of it soon I hope.

There's also sleeve knitting that I very much need to spend some time
on.

Back to writing.
