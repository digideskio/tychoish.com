*Editor's Note: I totally meant to publish this yesterday, but
apparently forgot to hit the "post" button. Eek. So here it is a little
late. Hope you're having a great weekend.*

I'm ashamed to say that I don't have any nifty philosophy for you this
week. On the other hand the `Deleuze
Carnival <http://sportivethoughts.com/2007/07/deleuzes-scientific-and-mathematical.html>`__
is up over at `Sportive Thoughts <http://sportivethoughts.com/>`__,
which includes some great, up to date blogging on Deleuze.

I had a discussion this week about a Robert Reid-Pharr essay I read in a
class some 3 years ago, that, perhaps more than `Gayle
Rubin <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Rubin>`__\ (!) continues to
define my notion of "queer," and as a result of this, I realized how
far, I sometimes stray from the core interests that got me into this. I
think part of this is because I was in a particularly dense part of
Deleuze, that dealt with issues that I don't find particularly relevant,
and I didn't have a good way to go beyond them. The thing I worry about
is that they're so irratic, that by skipping, you can miss gems in the
rough. So be it, I say.

Have a great weekend, I'll probably keep updating
`/tychoish <http://wtychoish.com>`__ over the weekend, though I can't
promise how interesting that will be. I'm reminded that I started that
blog as a virtual notebook, and here I am blogging. These things happen
I suppose. In any case, I'll be back next week, with more and better
things.

Cheers, tycho
