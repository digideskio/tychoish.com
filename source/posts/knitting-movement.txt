So I've been talking about how close I am to getting back on the
knitting game for weeks and weeks. While for the past two months I've
knitted more than I had in the previous two or three months, until this
last week, I still hadn't been knitting much.

And then, this last week, I'm not sure what happened, but I got enough
momentum on my projects that I've been able to make some real progress
on projects, and with that progress my interest and enthusiasm has grown
pretty significantly.

I don't have pictures or anything instructive yet, but I'm paying
attention to projects again, and thinking about what's going to be my
next project. I'll post the highlights and blog over the next several
days/week about more specific details.

1. I was knitting a teal sweater, using a possum/merino yarn that I
despise. Despite finishing (and steaking the neck opening,) I'm
tossing it in the frog/sell pile. The yarn sheds, it looks like there
are multiple dye/carding lots, and it's a really fuzzy yarn, to the
point that knitting it made me sneeze, and it shed, and it was too
warm to sit under and knit, let alone wear. Anyway, I think this is
well reasoned, and having it off of my plate makes me feel incredibly
good.

2. I finished the "Grey Sweater of Doom," or what I was fondly calling
"that god damned sweater," by the end. This is a sweater that I cast
on in the fall of 2005, and have been slowly working on, off and on
since then. The sweater is knit with a fingering weight lambswool and
alpaca. It's mostly plain but there are some small cable accents. In
a feat that I'm pretty proud of, I was able to make a perfectly
fitted sweater without swatching, [1]_ *and* since I knit off a cone,
with wool there were only 2 extra ends to weave in, in addition to
the normal edge ends (that is there were 6 ends total, but 4 of them
are conceptually unavoidable.) I'm proud of this one, and even though
it took forever, I want to make another one kind of like it.

3. The `Latvian Dreaming <http://tychoish.com/tags/latvian-dreaming>`__
Sweater. I have finished the body of this sweater, so all that
remains is the collar and the sleeves. This is a project that where
I'm conceptually giving away the pattern as I knit it. I'm a bit
behind, and have to write some instructions for the shoulders. But
this is a part of the pattern where there are a lot of options, so
there'll be a number of posts about this in the next few weeks.

4. A pair of socks. About a year ago I visited `Sheri at the Loopy
Ewe <http://www.theloopyewe.com/sheri/>`__ and bought a skein of
yarn, because it was amazing looking, despite the fact that I don't
really knit normal socks very often. So this skein lingered in the
stash, rolled up into a ball: apparently I got pretty close a while
back to casting on, but chickened out. Then on Saturday I picked it
up and cast on 64 stitches for a sock. It's going well, and I already
have 3-4 inches done.

That's all I have right now. How has your knitting been going.

.. [1] For the non-knitters, swatches are samples that you knit to help
   figure out how many stitches/knitting you need in a project. Also,
   while I don't usually don't swatch, in this case, the sweater is
   constructed in such a way that you don't need to know your gauge.
   This is pretty cool, I think.
