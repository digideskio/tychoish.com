Here's what I'm planning on writing (and revisiting to post) for the new
site, `Critical Futures <http://criticalfutures.com/>`__ which launches
on Monday and that I wrote about
`here <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/critical-futures/>`__. I'm going to
go from the stories that I've talked about least to the stories that
you're most familiar with, and I'll include a little bit of background
with each story/series.

- *Trailing Edge,* is just a working title for a nexus of stories in a
future world that's been left behind. Humans have been moving out,
continuously for hundreds of years and this has had a huge effect on
the people and worlds left in the wake of these great journeys. This
is the anti-epic story of those people and worlds.

- So this is an interesting story, I tried writing a story (which I
might post, and that I've blogged about extensively) that I was
calling *Breakout* about what happens on the "Leading Edge" of
this "progress," and it was during a rough space inside my own
head, and the story didn't really want to be in novel form, so I
tried writing it has a hypertext, and that didn't work either, so
I just let go. And then, I realized that maybe the more
interesting part of this world would be the "other side." And
while the original story had merits, and I might return to it in
some form, it's not calling to me in the same way.
- So I started writing this story, and I was thinking about the new
site at the same time, so as a result the story really fits this
new structure. The stories have a loose versioning system (so far
I have "Episodes" 1, 2, 2.1, and 2.2, and 3 in progress or
completed), and I write a page in one part or a page in another
part, pretty regularly, and it's good stuff. Like the *Mars*
story, I particularly enjoy how the narrative is multi-modal, that
there are different types of stories, different forms that I get
to explore. And the concept is pretty fun.
- It's a story written for the media: I talk about a handful of
things on tychoish, productivity, technology, knitting/spinning,
science fiction/writing, and in a way all of these are telling a
reasonably consistent story of me and what I'm interested in.
*Critical Futures* is sort of the same, except that rather than
technology and knitting, there'll be a couple of stories. And
within those stories--as within my discussion of, say,
technology--there'll be a number of different threads to the
story. And I'll write it as I go, and the experience of writing
fiction this way, is really appealing and compelling. Hopefully
you'll feel similarly.

- *Knowing Mars,* this is the novella I wrote last fall about a group
of human telepaths who are forced to leave Earth in order to keep the
secret of their ability safe... for a while.

- Interestingly, since I'm getting in the habit of explaining the
origins of the stories, this story descended from a novel that I
wrote while I was in high school. This isn't part of that story,
but rather an elaboration of the first six pages of the prologue
(which *really* didn't work). It's clearly a sort of quirky coming
out tale, and it's a fun story. It's a universe that I've got
worked out, and I expect that there'll be more related stories. (I
have one plotted out, mostly that I just have to write, and
another that isn't coherent in my mind, yet.)
- By the way there are about 30,000 words in this story, and one of
the biggest goals of this new site is to provide inspiration to
plow through and get the final edits done.

- *Station Keeping,* the story that I (and others) wrote last year, as
a sort of precursor to the current project. It's a far future space
opera, where "progress" has slowed to a crawl because of the
relativistic effects of travel, and the eons old social and political
institutions that hold humans together are beginning to crumble.
These stories explore the lives of the crew and residents of a space
station above a critical world in the budding new order.

- I think of it sort of told in the style of a TV show. Indeed I
intended to post a series of episodes as a teleplay, because you
know, I can. 12 episodes and about 10,000 words of this are old
material, and then I've written 4 more that haven't been posted
anywhere and I have plans at the moment for 36-40 episodes (of
uncertain total length).
- This is the remaining of a novel that I started writing but that
sort of fell apart on me when I was a teenager. The characters and
the setting were great, but the story is really a loose serial and
not novel-like so it's understandable that it didn't work out. Its
much more fun in this form.

And you know, odds and ends. I haven't given a lot of to the pacing. I
know I have enough content, and I do think that with a little
inspiration I can write enough, so we'll see how it goes. I also have an
inkling of some other folks that might contribute some stuff from time
to time, so we'll see. Stay tuned.
