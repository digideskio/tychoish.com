From the Psychology of Women Resource List by a Ph.D and emerita prof.
(as a response to a question about obsessive attachment, which from the
context seems to be the "emotion" which underlies stalking and what
not.) > I am not sure what behavior constitutes "obsessive attachment",
but it sounds like stalking which can be physically tracking someone or
repeated phone calls and other forms of pursuit. In California this is a
crime, not a mental illness. Victims are told to document every
occurrence in order to make their case and perpetrators should be told
that it is criminal behavior.

I'm curious as to how "crimes" particularly ones that only "exist" in
certain locales, therefore preludes classification as a "mental
illness." Clearly it's both "criminal" and "illness." Woot, overactive
either/or logic in wildly inappropriate settings, by people who should
know better.

Cheers, Sam
