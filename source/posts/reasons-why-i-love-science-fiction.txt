Reasons Why I Love Science Fiction

I interrupt your regularly scheduled programing for a couple of
announcements. First off, I bought a computer this evening. This is
a *Good Thing*, and I'm going to be getting settled in. There will
still be morning blog posts. Don't fear. Secondly I have a
cute/interesting story about science fiction writing.

So I wrote this short story last week that I'm putting the finishing
touches on.

It's cool to work on a fiction piece and then see the end or the
possible end in sight, rather than the work of enduring faith that novel
or even novella writing takes.

First a bit about the story: it's rather straightforward. Some
characters experience something and are changed by it. It's futuristic,
but the differences are mostly geographical and social (which is really
more of my speed.)

The first reviewers response: "I liked how the characters merged into
one entity and then split apart, I thought you slipped into first person
for a second, but then I realized it was intentional, good going."

Nope. I really did just slip into first person. The story started out as
a first person story, and then I realized that given the character's
state of mind throughout the story, it was absurd to have the character
narrate the story in past tense. And present tense is annoying.

And because I'm the writer and I can do these things, I changed it, save
the middle of one well placed paragraph. And only in science fiction
would that be seen as a literary device. Fear not, I've corrected the
mistake, and who knows, probably squashed any chance this story had at
being worthwhile.

Anyway, I have file transfers to attend to. Be well friends.
