(Ok, So I wrote this entry a few days ago, and just got around to
posting it now. That's fine. Enjoy!)

This has been one of those weeks. Not bad, really, just hectic.

See, my request for a new room in a different hall finally came up. See
I was living in the armpit of the campus, and some guy moved into TKE
(the pretty boy frat) and left an open room, which while bearing a
remarkable similarity to my old room, is on a much better floor in a
better building. The new building is virtually identical to the old one,
but it's not as grody.

The end result of that is that I packed up all of my earthly belongings
and moved them down. It felt good to see that I really don't have that
much stuff. If I worked at it, I could get rid of a box or two. I got
everything in the new room and started to unpack which took a lot of
energy. It was a struggle to find, and then put, the sheets on the bed
before I fell asleep. It took a couple of tried. I woke up once, having
wrapped myself in the mattress cover and fitted sheet.

Eventually though I got all the kinks worked out, and somehow managed to
get the sheets on the bed. I even managed to wake up in enough time to
get to class, which is itself a miracle because I didn't set the clock.
I even got up in time to eat a proper breakfast, which is better than I
did on Monday.

On the other hand, I was in such a rush this morning that I put my
underwear on backwards and it took me all day to notice.

Oy.
