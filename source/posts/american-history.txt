I present you with something I discovered whilst working on my current
project at work:

Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States
Constitution barred from office anyone who had violated their oath
to protect the Constitution by serving in the Confederacy. That
prohibition included Davis. In 1978, pursuant to authority granted
to Congress under the same section of the Amendment, Congress
posthumously removed the ban on Davis with a two-thirds vote of each
house and President Jimmy Carter signed it. These actions were
spearheaded by Congressman Trent Lott of Mississippi. Congress had
previously taken similar action on behalf of Robert E. Lee.

From `the wikipedia article on Jefferson
Davis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Davis>`__.

This is absurd. As a gesture, it sends a totally of backward political
message--but I think getting hung up the political significance of this
specific act of congress in the 70s, there's something larger at play
that I think we need to spend a moment on:

*In the 1970s, both houses of Congress and the President (of different
parties) passed a law that allowed someone who had been **dead** for 89
years to run for office.*

The conclusion?

Trent Lott knew about and was making legal preparations for zombies.

There is no other rational explanation.

Upon further reflection, as the resident of a state `who has elected a
dead person to federal
office <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Carnahan>`__, I think I can
safely grant my support to any dead candidate seeking office. As long as
we can be assured that they *stay* dead.
