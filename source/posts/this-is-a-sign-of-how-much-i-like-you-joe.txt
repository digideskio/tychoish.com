I so am not a meme person, but I had a few moments and, you know, why
not. I reserve the right to not play *exactly* by the rules

“\_The rules of the game get posted at the beginning. Each player
answers the questions about themselves. At the end of the post, the
player then tags 5-6 people and posts their names, then goes to their
blogs and leaves them a comment, letting them know they’ve been tagged
and asking them to read your blog.

Let the person who tagged you know when you’ve posted your answer.\_”

1. What was I doing 10 years ago?

- I was, being an awkward pre-teen. Getting ready for a year in
school, which I am convinced no one really enjoys, and I was no
exception. This is one of the side effects of being so young:
questions like these are embarrassing. Though, I've realized that
there are a number of things that I still do that I've been doing
for *almost* ten years. Like dancing is getting close, blogging is
getting close.

2. What are 5 things on my to-do list for today (not in any particular
order):

- Finish writing an episode of Station Keeping.
- Knit.
- Play with kittens.
- Read fiction.
- Work.

3. Snacks I enjoy:

- These awesome peanut filled pretzel's from Trader Joes.
- Graham Crackers.
- Feta Cheese. Other Cheeses.

4. Things I would do if I were a billionaire:

- Create endowments for a bunch of communities and institutions that
I appreciate and enjoy in the world. Like the local folk music
club, the queer youth group, etc.
- Start an independent science fiction book press.

5. Places I have lived (in no order at all):

- Nashville, TN.
- Southern Wisconsin.
- St. Louis, MO.
- Kansas City, KS Area

6. Peeps I want to know more about:

- `Zach <http://superikuhnits.blogspot.com/>`__
- `Dave <http://www.soliloqueer.com>`__ (Ok, so I know you pretty
well, play long)
- `Chris <http://www.cgkreality.com>`__ (Ditto 2x)
- `Ted <http://371790.blogspot.com/>`__ and
`Keith <http://lexiphane.blogspot.com/>`__
- `Ken <http://fey.ca/>`__

I'm totally breaking the rules and not going through the elaborate
rituatual of telling people to play along. I think most of those people
read the blog, and they're all people who I really like and consider my
"blogging friends," but they're people who don't typically comment here.
So I think you should read their sites if you don't already.
