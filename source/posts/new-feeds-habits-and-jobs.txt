New Feeds, Habits, and Jobs

(*I've been tinkering on this post all weekend, and I wanted to get it
out of the door before it's next week. Here goes!*)

I always forget, and there's no good reason for this, how difficult it
is to establish new routines and new habits. Two weeks ago, I moved for
the second time this year. this week I started a new job and even though
I have more free time than I did before, I'm still coming up at loose
ends and I find myself wondering why I have a hard time concentrating
and getting into "the grove." There's so much to do, so many tasks
collecting dust on my todo list, and I'm only *half* keeping ahead of
everything.

I have two things to report that I missed on the [[last
update\|the-week-that-was]]: I have new full-text feeds for posts about
[[org-mode\|/tag/org-mode/feed/]] and [[emacs\|/tag/emacs/feed]].
Hopefully these will get included in relevant planets soon for your
reading pleasure.

There's also been some [[discussion\|bad-org-mode-habits/discourse]] on
the "[[Bad Org Mode Habits\|bad-org-mode-habits]]" post. You may be
interested.

As an aside: the astute among you will notice that [[matt\|folk/madalu]]
and I have made a [[folk]] page that is automatically updated anytime
there's a page that links to or is tagged with Matt's handle (i.e.
"madalu.") This includes an RSS feed that he (or you) can use to track
his updates and mentions. Use the edit page functionality to see how to
make such a page for your own notification purposes.

--------------

Everything else on my list is pretty boring. I'm, slowly trying to
follow my own advice in [[bad org mode habits\|bad-org-mode-habits]].

The organization I was using for my lists and notes worked really well
when I was commuting all of the time and working off of laptops on the
go. Among other limitations, I think I basically had to give up any sort
of really complex project. Now that I have more time, I can tend to more
gnarly projects that I've wanted to tinker with that I just haven't had
the time for. Without a train ride and "home time" to define my free
time for fiction writing and other projects, it's been hard to adjust.

It has also been hard for me to get a real sense of how my free time
remains limited (because that's the nature of free time,) even if
there's a lot more of it to go around. Adjustment is always hard and
changes, particularly big changes, have a ripple effect. Things I've
been doing differently include:

- I've made some big changes to [[the blog post writing
tooling\|code/ikiwiki-el]], so that new blog posts are written in my
org-mode files rather than in their own directory. (I updated the
above emacs code with some shell functions that make the publication
process easier (if you're using that code.) This seems minor, but is
pretty big in terms of how I'm using org I've never really used org
for anything other than notes and one off projects. It's a good
shift.

- While I used to dock my laptop to the desk and use it with an
external monitor, I'm switching to just using the laptop dock and
working on the laptop on the desk. This might not be ergonomically
ideal, but it feels better and is a bit more coherent. Particularly
with the addition of a third laptop for work.

- I caved and installed emacs on my work laptop (Windows.) Rather than
adapt all of my emacs crap to work with Windows, I'm basically
copying and pasting the important parts, and starting from scratch.
It's not pretty, but it works. And being able to use emacs and do the
things that I want to do there, is a good thing indeed.

- With only a few thousand more words to go on the novel. I'm taking a
bit of a break to rethink things, and hopefully this afternoon
rewrite a few outlines so I have a good way of drawing this project
to a close. Then writing, then lots of editing and lots of other
writing.

- A bit more than two weeks ago, I got a new cell phone. It's a HTC
Inspire (ATT "4g,") and I like it rather a lot. I still think that
Blackberry does email and messaging better. This is a better computer
to have in your pocket. The Kindle App is really usable. I have a
text editor/note program that works great, and all the other little
incidentals just seem to work and be there. If only the messaging
where a bit better. eh.

- The new job is going well, though I'm still in the "I wonder what
this will look like when I'm actually fully up to speed" phase. I
expect that I'll write *even less* about this job than my last job,
and retreat further into "tycho." I like this. I may, however, write
some features of the new job: the fact that I'm using Windows on my
work machine and various aspects of digital collaboration, which I
*still* find fascinating.

That's all the news that's fit to print!
