So I was totally going to do a little more pre-blogging for today,
despite the fact that I had a little counting error last night, but
instead I wrote this
`response <http://tychoish.com/posts/class-and-the-facebookthe-myspace/>`__
for TealArt. It need to happen so it's a good thing that I wrote that.
You do read `TealArt <http://tychoish.com>`__, don't you?

For your tychoish does I'll point you to read what I wrote and also the
essay that I responded to. "`Viewing American class divisions through
Facebook and
MySpace <http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/ClassDivisions.html>`__."
It's worth your time.
