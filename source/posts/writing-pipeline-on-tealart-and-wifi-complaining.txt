Writing Pipeline on TealArt and WiFi Complaining

Hey, I have posted another TealArt entry on writing and planning.

I wrote this a while ago, and kept putting off posting it, for some
reason, and It's good to remind myself of this lesson, because I can be
really bad about keeping up on my planning. We really tend to measure
productivity in terms of the total amount of finalized output, not all
of the auxiliary tasks that make productivity possible. Like outlining,
or research. I'm really bad about letting research happen.

Anyway, cast your eyes `over here to read "Writing
Pipeline" <http://tychoish.com/posts/writing-pipeline/>`__
