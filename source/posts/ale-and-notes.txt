Hello folks!

I'm going to be away from early early in the morning until late in the
day on Monday, and (likely) asleep until late (for me) morning on
Tuesday, following the Midwest Morris Ale that I'm participating in this
weekend in Minneapolis Minnesota. The following notes are of interest:

1. I'll have my Blackberry, so if you need to get a hold of me, call,
email, text, whatever. I can't promise that I'll be super responsive,
but I won't go completely silent, but I'm mostly offline for the next
four days and some change. Sorry if this is a problem.

2. If you're in the twin cities, I'd *love* to see you. Check out the
`Ale Website <http://scynthius.com/index.html>`__ for more
information. If you happen across a Morris dancer in the twin cities
this weekend (May 22-25, 2009; likely on saturday) say, "I'm looking
for Sam of the Capering Roisters" and someone will find me.

3. No blog post on Monday.

4. Take care of yourself.
