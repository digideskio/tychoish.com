I've had "write post about writing/read sexuality" on my todo list for
too long and I wanted to make the general note before it got too stale.
In a lot of way's this is in response to
`Nora's <http://nkjemison.com>`__ `post on magic
district <http://magicdistrict.wordpress.com/2009/02/19/sex-sex-sex-sex-sex/>`__
and I think something else that I can't trace down the reference to.

Basically I saw a couple of things where non-normative sexualities (more
promiscuous, more casual, more queer) were underplayed or criticized
fiction because of concerns (real or other wise) that the non-norm
sexuality would be distracting or feel "Ham handed."

And I sort of gawk. Not because I think that this is incorrect. Writing
about queer sexualities in fictional contexts *is* distracting, and
something of a big deal, relative to non-queer sexualities in fiction. I
also think it's a bit distracting in real life, that the
discomfort/distracting experience that many people get isn't the result
of ham handed political message insertion into writing, but rather, a
fairly reasonable depiction of what it's like to have your embodied
experience politicized, to be (nearly constantly) reminded of the
cultural dissonance you have.

Sure, it's possible to under-represent queer lives in fiction, it's
possible to write queerness inappropriately, or to over-normalize it.
But if your readers are distracted, if they're made uncomfortable, you
probably did something right.
