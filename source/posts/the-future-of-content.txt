the future of content

I finally listened to `John Gruber and Merlin
Mann's <http://www.43folders.com/2009/03/25/blogs-turbocharged>`__
podcast of their talk at the 2009 SXSWi conference, on "how to succeed
at blogging/the Internet" and this, in combination with my ongoing
discussion with `enkerli <http://enkerli.wordpress.com/>`__ about the
future of journalism, and an article about `gawker
media <http://nymag.com/news/features/39319/index4.HTML>`__ has promoted
a series of loosely connected thoughts:

-  Newspapers are *dead*, *dead*, *dead*. This isn't particularly ground
breaking news, but I think it's interesting to make note of this fact
because of this corollary:

-  The Media/Content industry on the Internet has been unable to develop
a successful business model for funding the creation of content to
replace the business model of the newspapers (where newspapers fund
websites/writer and a model which doesn't revolve around
advertising.)

-  I've been talking about trying to figure out what constitutes success
at this "content creation thing," for a while, and I don't think I
have a good answer for what those markers of success are. I think
page views, are a part of it certainly, and I think the volume of
comments, and/or the number of twitter followers you have may be
markers of success, but I think we need to get to a place where we
think of success as being something a bit less concrete.

Success might be landing a cool new job because your blog impresses
someone. Success might be having enough of a following to be able to
sell enough copies of your book/CD/etc. to support yourself. Success
might be having enough page-views to support the site in advertising.
Success might be five people whose opinion you care about reading your
site. Success might be steady progress in the direction of having a
readership that eclipses the circulation of the print publications in
your field.

If we use these kinds of standards to judge our work, rather than the
standards of old school publishing (page views), it becomes easier to
making meaningful qualitative judgments of success.

-  Though I think they're largely correct about success, Gruber and
Mann's suggestions--I think--fail to explain their own success.

I think Merlin Mann is successful because he was friends with people
like Cory Doctorow and Danny O'Brien at the right moment, because the
GTD thing happened, because he's pretty funny, and because MacBreak
Weekly emerged at the right time and he played a big role in making that
podcast successful. At the same time I think Gruber is successful
because he took Apple Computer seriously at a time when no one really
did. And he wrote this thing called
`markdown <http://www.daringfireball.com/projects/markdown>`__. This
isn't to say that either isn't deserving of their success--hardly--but
their advice to just "passionately do your thing and embrace the
niche-yness and uniqueness of what you do," is a good, but I don't think
that's all it's going to take to be successful in the next five years.

Additionally I think there are a couple of unnecessary assumptions that
we've started to make about the future of content on the interent, that
are **worth questioning**. They are, quickly:

-  Blogging as we have known it will endure into the future.

-  Blogging is being fragmented by the emergence of things like twitter
and facebook.

-  User generated content (eg. youtube and digg) will destroy
professional content producers (ie. NBC and slashdot/the AP.)

-  (Creative) Content will be able to survive in an unstructured format.

-  MediaWiki is the best software to quickly run a wiki-based site.

-  Content Management Systems (drupal, wordpress, MediWiki, etc.) and
web programing frameworks (django, rails, drupal) are stable and
enduring in the way that we've come to expect operating systems to be
stable and enduring.

-  Content Management Systems, unlike the content they contain, can
mostly survive schisms into niches.

-  The key to successful content-based sites/projects is "more content,"
followed by "even more content." (ie. Quantity trumps all.)

If the singularity doesn't come first, that is.

ps. As I was sifting through my files I realized that `this amazing
article by Jeff
Vandermeer <http://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2009/05/12/booklife-excerpt-general-tips-on-pr/>`__
also, influenced this post to some greater or lesser extent, but I read
it about a week before I listened to the podcast, so I wasn't as aware
of its influence. Read that as well.
