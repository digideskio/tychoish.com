(that's of course the voice over from Joss Whedon's production company.)

I guess I don't have a great deal of news to report, but I feel like I
need to get a blog entry out, so here I am. I finished the body of the
sweater today (save the neck) that I've been working on for weeks and
weeks. I'm used a new shoulder shaping method, and I think that it is on
the whole a success, although I think there are a number of very finer
points in this sweater that didn't work out perfectly. This isn't a bad
thing, and there's a reason that I don't sell my finished products. I am
of course too lazy to go back and fix it, and since its shetland yarn,
I'm not sure that that would be a great idea. I will try and get
pictures of it up at some point, I might wait until there is a
neck/collar.

In other news, I had what is in retrospect a fairly surreal day, and I
have better hopes that tomorrow won't be so *frickin* weird. I did get
some good things done. Like I wrote some emails that had been nagging at
me, and I made a phone call that has been on my list(s) for far too
long, and I changed the font on TealArt, and fixed some of the errors in
the way the site renders (and I'm much more pleased with the way the
site looks as a result). I was also able to pull together a post for
TealArt this morning which is a good thing indeed.

One of the things I'm avoiding by writing this, is getting the first
part of the *station keeping* post that I have planned for tomorrow
ready, but frankly I don't trust myself.

Anyway, bed beckons, and I hope you're well. I'll be in touch.

Cheers, tycho
