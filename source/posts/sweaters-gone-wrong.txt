Sweaters Gone Wrong

This from the new Yarn Harlot Book. You know Stephanie, of the Yarn
Harlot. You can google just as quick as I can link.

"When a sweater goes wrong, it's much more spectacular than a
wayward scarf. You can laugh about a hat that came out weird for
maybe 10 minutes, but an unexpectedly "unique" sweater never stops
being funny (once you work through the period of grief and shock)"
(187).

Oh that's so the truth. I have my "star trek" sweater, my flairing cuff
hem sweater that was too small, the bulky cotton sweater attempt that
turned out to be a shawl the size of Nebraska, the 2 fair isle sweaters
with forearms that were too tight, the blue cardigan with the droopy
fronts and the two small.

Sigh.
