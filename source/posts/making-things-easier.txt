Making Things Easier

I spent a lot of time in the past few months thinking about
"automation," as a project to take things that take a long time and
require a lot of human intervention into things that *just do
themselves,* and I think this is the wrong approach.

While total automation is an admirable, it's difficult, both because it
requires more complex software to deal with edge cases, but also because
it's hard to iterate *into* a fully automated solution.

*Let's back up for a moment and talk about automation in general.*

Computers are great at automating things. When you figure out *how
exactly to accomplish something digitally* (i.e. polling an
information source for an update, transforming data, testing a
system or tool,) writing a program to perform this function is a
great idea: not only does it reduce the workload on actual people
(i.e. you.) **I think the difference between people who are "good
with computers," and people who are "great with computers," is the
ability to spot opportunities for these kinds of automations, and
potentially implement them..**

To my mind the most important reason to automate tasks is to ensure
consistency and to make it more likely that tedious tasks get done.

Having said this, rather than develop complete task automations for
common functions, the better solution is probably to approach automation
on the bottom up: instead of automating a complete process, automate
smaller pieces particularly the most repetitive and invariable parts,
and then provide a way for people to trigger the (now simplified) task.

The end result, is a system that's more flexible easier to write, and
less prone to failure under weird edge cases. Perhaps this is a
manifestation of "`worse is
better <http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WorseIsBetter>`__\ "
`also <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better>`__.
