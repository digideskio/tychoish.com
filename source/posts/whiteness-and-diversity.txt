Whiteness and Diversity

This post is a follow up to my earlier :doc:`post on diversity and
representation </rhizome/representation-and-race-futurism>`. In short,
while I think it's great that we're beginning to talk and write about
race and representation in our fiction and field, I think we [1]_ need
to expand our analysis of whiteness.

Whiteness in Science Fiction
----------------------------

I'm still working on figuring out what this means, and I'm sorry that I
haven't developed my thinking sufficiently to be more clear on this. In
light of that here are a collection of my thoughts on representation:

- Whiteness is multiple and I think it's possible (and important) to
  *depict whiteness and white characters critically and without
  recapitulating normalization*. At the same time, it's important to
  avoid falling victim to a lot of the normalization to which uncritical
  representations of racial diversity often fall pray.

- The theory around race and representation must deal with issues
  around assimilation. More diversity is useful, but to move forward
  on issues of representation, the field needs to better understand
  the process of assimilation. *I want to see stories that help us
  unpack assimilation.*

- Whiteness is complex and a major problem with stories that "don't do
  race well," is not just that the characters aren't explicitly of
  color, but that whiteness isn't portrayed very well. This is part of
  the struggle of privilege, but *not only does science fiction need
  to be better about diversity and representation of non-white
  characters, but we the thinking on whiteness needs to continue to
  evolve apace.*

Diversity and Quotas
--------------------

Discussions about diversity and representation in fiction often lead the
under-informed to ask "So what, do you want to impose some sort of quota
system? Does that mean diversity is more important than quality?"

The answer is almost always no.

I'd also like to point out that this is one of those cases where
whiteness and systematic bias conspire to define "quality," in unuseful
ways. But this is another argument for another time.

The canonical answer is: there's a great deal of amazing work written by
people of color and a lot of great fiction that incorporates and
addresses the experiences of people of color. This is great, and if
we've learned anything in the last couple of years, it's that if you
look for this work it's there. The real challenge revolves around
cultivating that work so that there's *more* of it, and promoting [2]_
that work so that there's a large audience.

.. [2] Promoting and marketing literature is by no means a solved
   problem under any conditions.
