How Hacker News and Social Editing has Jumped the Shark
=======================================================


How's that for a Malcolm Gladwell-style subtitle title?

`Alex Payne <http://al3x.net/>`__ posed a piece on why he thought that,
basically `Hacker News <http://news.ycombinator.com>`__ had `jumped the
shark <http://al3x.net/2011/02/22/solving-the-hacker-news-problem.html>`__.
He's right, of course, but I think that his analysis of the root cause
of the problem, and therefore the solution he proposes, is a bit too
optimistic.

It seems to me that all of these socially edited link-based blogs where
lots of people submit links and then the community votes on these
stories to generate headlines and a filtered and sorted selection of
content based on the appetites of the communities.

Hacker News tried, and succeeded for a time because the contributors
(people who voted on, submitted, and commented on items) was small and
focused enough that the content managed to coherent overall. There
wasn't enough content to necessarily overwhelm, both the readers and the
potential contributors, and most things were interesting to most people.
It was a golden age.

I think the problem with this model of generating content is that the
golden ages don't last very long. Sites "jump the shark" as the tightly
focused content of the early, gives way to a more loose, less
specialized, and more self-interested content submissions and
selections. The factors that I think lead to this are:

- There's too much content. Such sites should be "filters," and their
fundamental service is to take the whole internet and tell readers
"you should be reading this because we think it's
interesting/important." As communities of editors grow, as the
marketing power of filter sites increases, and if the "cost" of
submitting a link remains constant, then the use of the filter breaks
down and everyone gets overwhelmed.

- There's not enough focus/responsibility on the part of the editors.
When you have a few dedicated and professional editors, you begin to
see consistency and perspective and approach in the content that is
curated. When this function is distributed among a large group of
community members: amazing things can happen but that's not a
guarantee.

- Community edited sites tend to become incredibly self interested
after a certain point. There's a certain kind of story either about
the community itself or that strikes submitters as being "about the
kind of people that participate in the community, or "the kind of
thing that people who read the site might like," rather than things
that interest them. Perhaps some of this comes from the game-based
dynamic of rating systems and karma, perhaps it's just a *thing that
happens*.

In many ways, `Trivium <http://chneukirchen.org/trivium>`__ is probably
the best example of a link filter blog. Alex Payne points to MetaFilter
as an example of a site which has solved this problem, and although I
have had a MeFi account for years, I've never been able to really get
into it. Long story short, we still need editors and editorial vision,
and the issues we're seeing isn't about the "focus" of a community, as
much as it is a property of communities themselves.
