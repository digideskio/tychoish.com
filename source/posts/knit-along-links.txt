Knit Along Links

So it seems, that there might be *a little* interest in this knit along.

I'm going to post the first little bit of the pattern/project
description in a little while. In the mean time, I have a few links to
share with you.

1. I created a pattern on `ravelry <http://www.ravelry.com>`__:
http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/latvian-dreaming. Add it to
your queue, "cast on" for the project. Use it for reference. If
you're not on ravelry, I highly recommend joining.
2. Also on ravelry, I made a "tychoish knitting" group. Even if you
don't want to do this project, I'm sure there'll be other things that
this group will get used for. Here's the url:
http://www.ravelry.com/groups/tychoish-knitting.
3. I've posted a zip file with the first version of the resource files.
This includes the excel file, a couple of PDFs and text and HTML
versions of a rough Readme file. It's located on Lulu and you can get
to it here: http://www.lulu.com/content/2470929.

Ok, that's all for now. I want to find something non-knitting related,
to try and keep the site at least a little balanced. Maybe a loosing
cause? I sense a post about tea coming in the near future.
