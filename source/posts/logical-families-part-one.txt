Logical Families, Part One

Here's a mostly accurate conversation I had with a friend the other day.
Once the secret is out, I'll tell you more about the actors, and it
might make sense, but for now, lets just go with it.

Jon's someone I've known since high school, and though, as you might
have guessed, we've bounced around the country a fair bit, and changed a
lot, we're still right there.

**jon**: I promised him I'd keep this between us for right now
**tycho**: whatever, I'm practically you **jon**: true that: a much
more together version of me... and cuter **tycho**: psh... I mean,
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is cuter than you, but whatever **jon**:
hahahaha. at least you're honest **tycho**: I think dating cuter
people is ok, I'm ok with that **jon**: yeah, I'm fine with
\_\_\_\_\_\_ being cuter than me too.

*conversation proceeds*

**tycho** develops a nickname for \_\_\_\_\_\_, a mutual friend: I'm
so calling him that henceforth **jon**: *CENSORED* **tycho**:
whatever, whatever **jon**: I promised! **tycho**: I think you need
to say to \_\_\_\_\_\_ something like "so, I have this brother that
knows me too well, but he's trustworthy," because we're basically
family, duder. **jon**: I know

*pause*

**jon**: my mom told me that she's always wanted a jewish son, when
I told her that you and I were brothers, basically... **tycho**: oh
dear.... funny though.

Like most conversations this one doesn't have some larger purpose, and
sort of meanders around. But that's the joy of conversations, right?
I've also done some artistic touching up to make it flow a little better
with the missing parts, but otherwise it's pretty spot on.

I'll post some more coherent thoughts a little later.
