For Some Practical Anthropology.

"Since I got here in Okondjato I am wondering how they all became
poor. I say ‚ "became‚" because one day their forefathers maybe were
not so different than they are now, always around their fires, all
drunk, dancing and singing songs, but they were not poor, they were
traditional."

(Via AnthroBoundaries.)
