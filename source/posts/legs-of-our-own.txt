/tychoish, this blog, will have its new home at http://tychoish.com in a
few days.

I'm kind of excited about this. If nothing else it means that I've
committed, in at least a minor way, to doing this blog for the next
year.

This has been an interesting weekend for me. I have a short week and
then `knitting camp <http://www.schoolhouseepress.com>`__ ahead of me,
which is exciting but I realize that I have what can only be described
as a crapton of work to get done before then.

While I'm taking the weekend off of blogging this week, I think it'll be
hit or miss. generally I think blogs need to be active during the work
week, and because *tychoish*, isn't quite as structured, (and it's a lot
of fun) I can see posting on the weekend, but I'm undecided. We'll see
how things work.

cheers!
