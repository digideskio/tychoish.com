Editor Crisis

When I got the Linux rig, I was pretty sure that I was going to live in
`vim <http://www.vim.org/>`__--probably mostly the console
version--while I work on weaning myself off of my
`TextMate <http://www.macromates.com/>`__ dependency. It's not that I
don't love TextMate, or that I can't afford it, but I think Linux/open
source is where I'm headed, and in the short term I think I'd like one
editor for both platforms, and that means open source. The problem? Vim
is great, but I find it sort of tedious for day to day editing...

This is probably the result of the fact that most of my personal text
processing (like 80%) is prose of one form or another, with the
remainder being very limited code-related things. Vim is great if most
of what you're doing is jumping around in a file, re-factoring code, and
hunting for little bugs to tweak. It's not so good if you're writing a
novel or a story and you only put carriage returns after each paragraph.
I like vim a lot for short editing tasks, for writing email, for proof
reading a document. For heavy duty lifting? I'm not yet decided.

I should introduce another character/factor into this story: my editing
habit. Basically rather than grouping similar files into one
window/buffer and toggling between various files, I really like having a
bunch of different windows open. A bunch might understate it. At this
moment I have 4/5 TextMate windows open, and I should probably have at
least 7 (if I were more on top of my tasks) and more like 10-15 wouldn't
be out of the norm.

Console vim works *great* with this usage paradigm, open a bunch of
terminal windows, open them to the documents that they need to edit, and
tag the terminals properly in
`Awesome <http://awesome.naquadah.org/>`__, and I'm good go, except we
run into problem 1 (editing prose in vim is bothersome). I've tried (and
quite like) a GUI vim called
"`Cream <http://cream.sourceforge.net/>`__\ " that totally fixes problem
1, but utterly fails at problem 2 (the usage paradigm).

So this leaves me? Using a hodge podge of solutions. I've taken to using
gedit--of all things--for most prose writing. Gedit is the Gnome editor,
and if you customize it right, it's reasonably functional. I haven't
been able to hack Markdown support into it (and I haven't bothered with
vim, so I must not be to keen upon it), and it won't post blog entries
like TextMate, but it's decent, and I can have a number of different
container windows, so I don't end up with a window with 20 different
tabs open that I can't find anything in, and I use vim for anything that
it seems like I can get away with.

`Jack <http://www.metajack.im/>`__ has been pestering me to convert to
emacs for a while now, and after all this fuss, it's tempting. Emacs can
handle blog posting, it's fundamentally a bit more like TextMate, [1]_
with "longlines-mode" it seems to handle prose pretty well, and the
quirky things that I like about TextMate like its `Screenwriting
Bundle <http://code.google.com/p/screenbundle/>`__ and LaTeX support
seem to be handled a bit better in emacs. The multi-window usage
paradigm is counter to the general emacs way of thinking, so that might
be an issue. But the largest problem by far, is that to a newbie [2]_
like me it's like an alien world. Surprisingly enough, (e)lisp code is
pretty easy to read, and the key commands are pretty easy to deal
with. [3]_ So who know, I might make the switch yet.

Stranger things have happened.

.. [1] It's like we're not so much reliving the editor wars, as seeing
   resonances/shockwaves from them. For instance the key bindings have a
   lot of emacs in them, while Google Reader definitely seems like it
   was made by vim users. I think we should start a game of trying to
   figure out which apps and environments were inspired by which editor.

.. [2] I somehow manage to be both a huge advanced geek, (I live in
   terminals, I bought a linux desktop to run a tiling window manager, I
   almost live in text editors, etc.) And also I'm not a programer, and
   I don't have any background in that sort of thing, so the most
   rudimentary of coding things can confuse me terribly. It's a weird
   boundary to walk, and I should probably expand on it later.

.. [3] I've had my caps-lock key mapped to "control" for years now. I think
   I should probably--for maximum emacs foo--remap my right shift key to
   alt, but I'm withholding judgement for the moment.
