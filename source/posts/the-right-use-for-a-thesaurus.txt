==============================
the right use for a thesaurus

It's one of those conical pieces of writerly advice: "don't abuse the
thesaurus." The problem being that you find words that are unnatural and
discordant with your tone and style, and they stick out, and it sounds
bad and reads worse.

In a similar vein I remember someone quoted Heinlein as saying that
always wrote adult novels using the simplest language he could think of,
for accessibility reasons, but in young adult novels, or stories pitched
to the YA audience, he would occasionally throw in a hard word, because
kids liked feeling like they were being trusted to be smart enough to
handle complicated things.

So I'll admit that I occasionally use a thesaurus. More often than not,
it's to remember a simpler word. Like, in something I'm currently
writing, I just looked up "concern" to find "interest," because I was
having something of fixation, and the reference was good to get me
unstuck. We can all imagine, of course, how this could have gone awry.
