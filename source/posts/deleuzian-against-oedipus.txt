Deleuzian: Against Oedipus
==========================

I've always had a somewhat strained relationship with psychoanalysis and
Freud, as you might expect, given that I'm generally a fairly rational
human being. I mean, really, psychoanalysis doesn't really present a
very good (or accurate) picture of how mental experience or culture
functions, and frankly--and perhaps this comes from Deleuze and
Guatteri--it seems like the analyical tradition is as inscriptive as it
is descriptive. Which is ok, if that's your thing, but it's not mine.
The problem with this is that there are a lot of thinkers who've been
influenced by the psychoanalytic tradition that, I think on the whole,
have something interesting to say. Deleuze and Guatteri for instance,
but also folk like Julia Kristeva, Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida: you
know all the angsty continental intellectuals of the last 30 years. All
this despite the psychonalysis, I'd be inclined to say.

I'm also reminded of a conversation I had with a professsor in which I
made a typical complaint about psychoanalytically-derived theories as
being "a lousy explanation for mental experience," and "not based in any
sort of meaningful understanding of reality." In response she said
something like "it's interesting that people don't go after Marx for
that," which is to say, we accept a lot of Marxist ideas on faith in
ways that we won't for psychonalysis. Now for the record I'm *totally*
ok with that, but I think in the larger sense she's right, we tend to
dismiss a lot of Freudian based thought wholesale without really
engaging with it. That's what this week's essay is about. Sort of.

As I return to *Anti-Oedipus*, I'm struck by how much I absolutely hated
the second chapter, which is all about the function (or non-function) of
Oedipus in the world as a result of psychoanalytic theory. While I admit
that I'm only beginning on the third chapter, I am realizing how
important it is that this book "deal with" Oedipus. I think in my
reading of this, I was drawn to passages that allowed me to connect with
Deleuze and Guatteri's psychodynamics, and also learn anti-oedipalism.
Also, as a side note about this part of the text: it's pretty clever
writing, there are parts that were honest-to-g-d funny enough to laugh
out loud. That's why I love this book. Anyway, here's what I found:

"For the unconscious itself is no more structural than personal, it
does not symbolize any more than it imagines or represents; it
engineers, it is mechanic. Neither imaginary nor symbolic, it is the
Real in itself, the 'impossible real' and its production" (53).

I rather like the way that this sums up their idea of psychodynamics,
and at least for my purposes it allows Deleuze and Guatteri to both
engage psychoanalytical theories without accepting the suppressions,
while still working in "some sort of meaningful understanding of
reality." Furthermore, I think way of thinking about psychoanalytic
theory makes it possible to both engage the tradition in a productive
way without subscribing to its more unhelpful/insidious aspects. This is
very much in line with the sort of thinking/approach that I looked at
`last
week <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/deleuzeian-desiring-machines/>`__.

In the spirt of rethinking the tradition they say, "We are so molded by
Oedipus that we find it hard to imagine another use" (76), given the
inscriptive nature of psychoanalysis and Oedipus, reforming is
incredibly hard to think beyond it. This is clearly where a lot of
people fall down (I'd point to Kristeva, if I had more experience with
her), but I think this is part of the reason that new ideas are so
incredibly hard to come by. I mean if you take a step back and look at
Deleuze and Guatteri, (and perhaps this is a product of how I'm thinking
about them, but) it's easy to see their project as being incredibly
Hegelian: this isn't a bad thing, necessarily, but a useful example.

Back to Oedipus for a moment:

"Oedipus is completely useless, except for tying off the unconscious
on both sides. We shall see in what sense Oedipus is strictly
'undecidable' (*ind√©cidable*), as the mathematicians would put. We
are extremely tired of those stories where one is said to be in good
health because of Oedipus, sick from Oedipus, and suffering from
various illnesses under the influence of Oedipus" (81).

This critique isn't difficult to swallow, and I completely endorse this
point. But I didn't need to read eighty pages to get to this conclusion,
thankfully they propose a solution:

"It is not the purpose of schizoanalysis to resolve Oedipus, it does
not intend to resolve it better than Oedipal psychoanalysis. Its aim
is to de-oedipalize the unconscious in order to reach the real
problems. Schizoanalysis proposes to reach those regions of the
orphan unconscious--indeed 'beyond all law'-- where the problem of
oedipus can no longer even be raised" (81-2).

This passage comes from a chapter of the book (#2) that is the
foundation of their criticism of Oedipus, the discussion of
schizoanalysis, based upon my reading of the table of contents comes
later. But I think this early summary is helpful in saying "there's a
way out, just hang on for it," and "arguing against oedipus isn't the
answer." And I hope there is.

Though this is a sticky section of the book, I do want to reiterate that
this is still a rather entertaining text: as I was searching for these
parts I found myself chuckling at some passages, and others that I had
annotated with "ha!"'s and smiley faces. Maybe I'm weird, but that's
part of the reason I liked this book so much.

Stay tuned, and I hope you have a good weekend.

Best, tycho
