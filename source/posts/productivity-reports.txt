Productivity Reports

I'm somewhat hesitant to write a post about this new habit I'm forming,
because I kind of like this habit and usually no sooner do I write about
some productivity related topic, as I decide to completely reorganize my
process. Here's what I'm doing:

I've started keeping a daily archive of what I get done/finish/do in any
given day. This includes information about everything from knitting, to
the number of words I write on a project, to what I read. There are a
couple of ideas at play in this:

1. *I do more things than I give myself credit for.* Even when I'm not
doing things that need getting done in the strictest sense, its not
like I'm not doing **anything**. I've found it helpful to keep track
of these things, and give my self credit for all the things I do, not
just those things that I think need doing before I do them.
2. *Knowing what you've done is useful for project planning.* I must
admit, that when I do something on my To-do list I delete it, rather
than strike it out or move it to a new list. This additional helps me
stay aware of what I'm doing through out the day, and keep track of
time.
3. *Allows for more proper reviews.* The only way to do a proper review
is to collect data in the moment, rather than in retrospect, where
memory and mood can play havoc on an accurate view of the past. I
almost always feel like I've gotten more done after reading a list
than I would otherwise.

I maintain this list using a `markdown
template <http://tychoish.com/files/reports.txt>`__ that I keep in my
`Quicksilver Template
Folder <http://www.tuaw.com/2007/03/26/quicksilver-tip-for-switchers-make-new-file/>`__.
I append new accomplishments using
`Quicksilver <http://quiksilver.blacktree.com/>`__\  [1]_ or a nifty
shell script that I wrote, and keep an eye on the list using
`GeekTool <http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/>`__ (It shows up on
my desktop right next two the todo list), and I have to say that it's
pretty darn nifty. I keep tweaking the template every now and then as it
suits. Should I ever need to produce a report, or whatever, I can simply
combine the files that I need and run it through a
`markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`__ converter
and have a great looking `XHTML <http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/>`__ file.

I'm a big fan, and maybe you will find this kind of a list helpful in
your day-to-day organization.

cheers, tycho

I begin every line with a "-" which markdown uses to make a bulleted
list. Except I never complie it using markdown, so it's
theoretical/make believe at this point.
