I listened to the podcast of "After The Siege," a novella by Cory
Doctorow, the other week (I've been driving cross country and walking a
lot, I'm going through a lot of audio.) It was really cool and I thought
it would be good to post a few notes. (For those of you who want to skip
right to the podcast, `here's the
link <http://subterraneanpress.com/index.php/magazine/spring-2008/audioafter-the-siege-by-cory-doctorow/>`__,
but I'd get the files straight from `cory's
podcast <http://www.craphound.com/podcast/>`__).

The reading was done by `Mary Robinette
Kowal <http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/>`__, and it was amazing. I
very much enjoyed the story, but it was a bit rough for me, at least
politically. The story science-fictionalizes stories from the author's
grandmother's experiences during the Siege of Leningrad during World War
II, to tell a story about contemporary American Imperialism.
Politically, something about this comparison, seems a bit fraught; both
in its scope, and in the way it understands American Imperialism.

I think it's probably a sign that my politics come very close to
intersecting with Cory's that I get so `riled up in response to some of
his
fiction <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/the-things-that-make-me-weak-and-strange/>`__.
When there's no chance that I'm going to agree with someone, the fact
that I *don't* agree doesn't worry me. When I'm pretty close, it's a
more troubling concern. The story is, however, quite good, so go listen.
