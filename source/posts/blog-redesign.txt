Blog Redesign

I've mentioned that I'm in the process of doing a somewhat lengthy "blog
redesign" project of tychoish.com. The astute among you, who don't visit
via RSS, will probably notice at least a little bit of a change
recently, but I think there's more in mind. While I resist the
temptation to write lists in my posts, I think I'm going to give in
*just this once.* ;)

What I hope to accomplish in this redesign.
-------------------------------------------

I want to have a home page that's more dynamic. I think the fact that
the landing page looks the same as *every other page on the site* is a
sore spot for me. I want to go for a site that has:

-  A list of recent essays
-  The most recent essay
-  Excerpts from a couple (2) other recent entries
-  Links to other Blogs
-  Several (3-5) recent coda posts.

In general, I think that the landing page should provide a good gateway
to what's happening on the site, it should be dynamic and simple. It
should load fast, and it should be more "clean." I'm also considering
digging up some AJAX bits so that I can have a couple of design widths
(so that I can avoid variable width designs) and also have a dynamic
browser for, say the excerpts of recent posts, and the coda posts.

I also want tychoish to be less of a blog, and more of a host to
different/additional kinds of activity. Like I'll probably host a wiki
here for the research I'm working on with open source, and I think it
would be fun to make some conceptual space on the site for something
other than *just another blog*, and see what happens. Given the shape
that my "career" is headed, I think this has some pretty interesting
possibilities.

How I plan to accomplish this redesign.
---------------------------------------

Slowly.

The first order of business, is to start to play with the templates and
design *before* I switch to some new system. I think trying to juggle a
smooth transition with two balls in the air is just an invitation for me
to screw things up royally.

The basic template for blog pages, will probably linger for a while
longer than the front page, and that's fine. I'm kind of fond of the
site. It's functional, it's simplistic and very "old school," which
suits me just fine.

Steps towards implementation:

1. Write additional CSS classes to describe a new layout. Including
rounded corners. (Grrr.)
2. Create JavaScript enhancements that make the site pop a bit, while
also making the vast quantity of text more digestible.
3. Create template files for wordpress to facilitate the export to the
new system.
4. Create staging area(s). For testing purposes.
5. Move to a host that gives more administrative rights.
6. Profit?

Why this is a good thing.
-------------------------

My hope is to make my blogging system/environment much more modular, so
that I can add and modify it more easily. The CMS's I was using 5 years
ago where much more along these lines, and while I didn't know what I
was doing very much I did appreciate that level of control.

To say "I want a more modular and dynamic" website sounds a bit trite,
but I think it's the most true. If the site's more modular, that is, if
template organization and content display (which are the same thing with
WordPress) are less connected, I think I'll be able to have all the
benefits of "dynamically generated pages" without the overhead of the
database system. And if that's the case, then my relationship to the
content of the site isn't via a constrained text field in one system,
which I think will be a good thing, indeed.

Or I hope, at least.
