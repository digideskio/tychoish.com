dweebishness of linux users

I ran across this `smear piece with regards to Ubuntu users from the
perspective of a seasoned Linux
user <http://ubuntusyndrome.wordpress.com/2009/04/23/linux-users-ar-to-ubuntu-users-what-men-are-to/>`__,
which I think resonates both with the problem of `treating your users
like idiots <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/idiot-users/>`__ and
differently with the kerfuffle over `ubuntu
one <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/freedom-and-ubuntu-one/>`__, though
this post is a direct sequel to neither post.

The article in question makes critique (sort of) that a little bit of
knowledge is a terrible thing, and that by making Linux/Unix open to a
less technical swath of users, that the quality of the discourse around
the linux world has taken a nose dive. It's a sort of "grumble grumble
get off my lawn, kid," sort of argument, and while the elitist approach
is off-putting (but total par for the course in hacker communities,) I
think the post does resonate with a couple of very real phenomena:

1. Ubuntu has led the way for Linux to become a viable option for
advanced beginner and intermediate computer users. Particularly since
the beginning of 2008 (eg. the 8.04 release). Ubuntu just works, and
a lot of people who know their way around a keyboard and a mouse are
and can be comfortable using Linux for most of their computing tasks.
This necessarily changes the makeup of the typical "Linux User" quite
a bit, and I think welcoming these people into the fold can be a
challenge, particularly for the more advanced users who have come to
expect something very different from the "Linux Community."

2. This is mostly Microsoft's fault, but people who started
using--likely Windows powered--computers in the nineties (which is a
huge portion of people out there), being an 'intermediate' means a
much different kind of understanding that "old school" Linux users
have.

Using a Windows machine effectively, and knowing how to use one of these
systems, revolves around knowing what controls are where in the control
panel, around being able to "guess" where various settings are within
applications, knowing how to keep track of windows that aren't visible,
understanding the hierarchy of the file system, and knowing to reboot
early and often. By contrast, using a Linux Machine effectively revolves
around understanding the user/group/file permissions system,
understanding the architecture of the system/desktop stack, knowing your
way around a command line window, and the package manager, and knowing
how to edit configuration files if needed.

In short, skills aren't as transferable between operating systems as
they may have once been.

Ubuntu, for it's flaws (tenuous relationship with the Debian Project,
peculiar release cycle), seems to know what it takes to make a system
usable with very little upfront cost: How the installer needs to work,
how to provide and organize the graphical configuration tools, and how
to provide a base installation that is familiar and functional to a
broad swath of potential users.

While this does change the dynamic of the community, it's also *the only
way* that linux on the desktop is going to grow. The transition between
*windows power user* and *linux user* is not a direct one. (While
arguably the transition between OS X and Linux is reasonably straight
forward.) The new people who come to the linux desktop are by-and-large
going to be users who are quite different from the folks who have
historically used Linux.

At the same time, one of the magical things about free software is that
the very act of using free software educates users about how their
software works and how their machines work. The cause of this is
partially intentional, partly by virtue of the fact that much free
software is designed to be used by the people who wrote the software,
and partly because of free software's adoptive home of UNIX-liken
systems. Regardless of the reason however, we can expect that even the
most "n00bish" of users to eventually become more skilled and
knowledgeable.

--------------

Having said that, in direct response to the `article in
question <http://ubuntusyndrome.wordpress.com/2009/04/23/linux-users-ar-to-ubuntu-users-what-men-are-to/>`__,
even though I'm a huge devote of a "real" text editor, might it be the
case that the era of the "do everything text editor" may be coming to an
end? My thought is not that emacs and vi are no longer applicable, but
the truth is that building specialized domain specific editing
applications is easy enough that building such editing applications
inside of vi/emacs doesn't make the same sort of sense that it made a
twenty or thirty years ago? Sure a class of programmers will probably
always use emacs, or something like it, but I think the change of emacs
being supplanted by things-that-aren't editors, say, is something that
isn't too difficult to imagine.

If the `singularity doesn't come
first <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/the-dark-singularity/>`__, that is.
