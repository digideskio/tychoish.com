While I enjoy being a morning person most of the time, I think that
there are definite advantages to being able to sleep in more
effectively. If I had gotten more sleep, I would probably be able to
think of a few of them.

I also thought that I had a paper for school due on Wednesday, which I
have since learned is due on Friday. I am no longer worried about it,
since I have finished reading the relevant book last night, in
expectation of a need to write the paper today. I can be leisurely about
it now.

I'll have to see what the undergrad classes are next semester, but I'm
thinking of starting to take classes in what promises to be an even more
mind dulling but applied masters program, because if I'm going to be
sitting around, learning things I already basically know, I think the
telos of a degree that I don't already have would be nice.

I should write a TealArt entry commenting on Station Keeping, or put
together an SK pdf file, but I think that'll have to wait for later.
Maybe, we'll see. I'm already caught up on the RSS feeds, which is kind
of crazy, just saying....

Cheers, sam
