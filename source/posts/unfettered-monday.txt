`Fantisque Unfettered <http://www.fantastique-unfettered.com/>`__ is a
new fantasy magazine from the editorial team that did the `Aether
Age
<http://www.amazon.com/The-Aether-Age-Christopher-Fletcher/dp/0982725671>`__
shared world project. You can learn more about this by
listening to the latest version of the `outer alliance
podcast <http://blog.outeralliance.org/archives/725>`__. I must confess
that reading/listening to *all* of these things is still in my queue,
but I have a lot of respect for the creators of all of these things, and
I'd love for this wiki play host to a [[discussion of any of these
works\|critique]].

I pulled together an archive or collection of my `Critical
Futures <http://criticalfutures.com>`__ posts that discuss systems
administration, administrators, and what "normal" folks can learn about
technology and techno/social phenomena from the practice of system
administration. I'm calling it "`Lessons from Systems
Administration <[http://criticalfutures.com/archive/from-systems-administration/>`__."
If anyone has an idea for a more archives for Critical Futures posts,
:doc:`use this wiki page </archives/>`.

I hope your week is awesome!
