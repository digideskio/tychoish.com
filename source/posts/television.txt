I just watched the season finale of Torchwood, and the season premiere
of Battlestar Galactica, season 4.

Oh. My. G-d.

Torchwood was amazing. I felt Ianto could have been less catatonic in
the last moment, but it was really nice. James Masters was perfect. The
last few torchwood eps were really poorly written--in my view--but this
one was good.

And Battlestar. Oh BSG. This was an episode that basically said "we're
back," but nothing happened, which was frustrating. But the last episode
in season 3 was so incredibly powerful, so it's not particularly
surprising that the emotional energy wasn't as strong, particularly
since we've all had so long for the tension to build.

Ok, I'm done being a fan, your more usual tychoish will return tomorrow.
While generally I think spoilers are a bad thing to post without warning
on the internet, I think the comments to this entry should be fair game
for spoilers if anyone has them...

Onward and Upward!
