Sweater Evolutions

I've been knitting! Here's an update:

- I finished a sweater. Still need to block it, but it looks great so
  far. It's a (near) duplicate of a sweater that I made a few years
  ago in blues. The biggest difference in construction is that I did
  the hem in a very slightly different way. Other than that, it's very
  much the exemplar of "the default tychoish sweater." 
  
  Note to self, it would be good to have a version of
  this sweater in brown. 
  
- I started another sweater. This one is a medium gray and light
  blue-gray as a cardigan. Rather than do hems, the idea with this is: 
  
  - purl when you can and want to border. 
  
    This is an Elizabeth Zimmerman and Meg Swansen technique for
    colorwork to avoid ribbing or hems. If you purl occasionally in
    the first few inches, you can prevent rolling. Seems to work well
    enough, and it makes the bottom edge less bulky and more
    integrated into the sweater.
    
  - Crocheted front steek with knitted cord (i-cord) edge, using the
    steek as facing.
    
    Another Meg Swansen technique where you use the steek as facing,
    by crocheting along the edges and then knitting an i-cord to cause
    the steak to "fold" under and act as a facing. Blocking does the
    rest. Again, the end result is lightweight, flexible, and easy to
    handle.

  I have about five inches done, and I expect slow but steady progress
  on this over the next few months.
