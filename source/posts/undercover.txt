*This is a post drafted a couple of weeks ago, while I was still doing
the commute.*

I wonder sometimes, what the people on the trains I take actually do.
While there's some variation on who's aboard, there's a very common and
consistent cast of characters on each leg of my journey. God only knows
what they're doing.

One fellow, I've spent the winter thinking of as "the short dorky one."
He's white and pretty pale, has darkish-blond with hair that's seems too
long, under 5'6," and wears glasses that are several years behind
current styles, his teeth are noticibly in a poor condition. I should
also point out that my commute is largely "pre-rush hour," and that I
see this fellow around 6:20 in the morning.

Today, he wasn't wearing the oversized and a bit more than "slightly
worn" jacket and I noticed two things: first he was muscular in a way
that suggested he put some time into the appearance and, two his entire
right arm was covered by a tattoo. I would have never pegged him as the
type, and none of the fantastic stories I would have thought to tell
myself about him included either of these details.

Most of the time, my primary reaction to my fellow commuters is
annoyance when they won't stop talking or using their cell phones.
Sometimes, I'm just confounded.

Welcome to life.
