"tychoish" is a weblog that is something of a mashup of new and old
weblog styles. New in the sense that I'm powering it using the latest
and greatest from `Wordpress <http://www.wordpress.org>`__, and the
general idea of the
`tumblelog <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblelog>`__; and old in the
sense that of tone and organization.

It seems to me that at some point weblogs started being "about things"
rather than running collections of personal wanderings, ramblings, and
information. In a lot of way this is the model that
`TealArt <http://tychoish.com>`__ still uses, but it's my intention that
TealArt collect essays and slightly more formal pieces.

I've tried a number of times to write less formal blogs, most
successfully using the LiveJournals `Clever on
Demand <http://celchu19.livejounral.com>`__ and `Awkward, but Enderingly
Colloquial <http://tychoish.livejournal.com>`__. (Usernames celchu19 and
tychoish respectively) While I'm still fond of some of the community
aspects of LiveJournal, I like the prospect of doing it on my own, and
having more control over the whole process. I've also
`tried <http://tychoish.tumblr.com>`__
`tumblr <http://www.tumblr.com>`__ and I've been generally displeased
with the experience. And while microbloging services like
`jaiku <http://tychoish.jaiku.com/>`__ and
`twitter <http://www.twitter.com/tychoish/>`__ are great fun, they're
not the same as what I have in mind for this site.

In this vein, this site will have short, (mostly) unedited, and rambling
posts, quotes and exchanges too funny to let go by, lists of various
kinds, and anything else that just needs to get out. With luck, we'll
also syndicate this mess in the TealArt sidebar. It will be delicious.
