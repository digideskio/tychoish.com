On Monday, that is next Monday (there! a firm week from now--if slightly
relative--commitment) I'm going to start a posting to a new blog. This
isn't breaking news to readers of this site as I've been talking about
this with some of you for weeks, and mentioning it sporadically on the
blog. Let me tell you about the site, and what I intend for it.

The site will be called `Critical
Futures <http://criticalfutures.com/>`__, and it will be a fiction blog
where I (and possibly others) will post a new piece of science fiction
every day. Not necessarily, as `365
Tomorrows <http://www.365tomorrows.com/>`__ posts an new *independent*
story every day, but rather a new section or part of an ongoing story. I
mean sometimes I might fit a whole story into a single post, but that's
not a goal that I'm aiming for as a writer.

**ETA:** The site isn't, of course, up yet, but you can `read the
about page <http://criticalfutures.com/about/>`__ if you want a
sneak preview. Remember next Monday.

I've really grown to be fond of the regular blogging rhythm, and I think
it would be nice to expand that habit into fiction writing. So the
prospect of having a regular commitment to write and polish fiction for
publication, will be a good thing. Kind of like the 365 projects, only
different.

And I've been talking for a long time about a few things for a while:
how blogging as a medium has potential for story telling, about how I
want to write a story intended for online distribution. So I'm going to
do it. Now. Because there's no time like the present, and because I
think that the most important thing for me to do right now is to just
get content out there, and I think I'm at a point where I'd rather write
toward a digital rather than a print audience. All the stars seemed to
align, and in these cases I think it's important to seize the moment and
get stuff out there. So that's what I'm doing.

So stay tuned. I'll be posting little mini-entries here to announce the
stories when they start to go up, and I have an entry for tomorrow that
will cover/overview the story projects that I've been working on for the
site. I'm really excited about this.
