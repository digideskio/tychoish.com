for `judy <http://metallumai.livejournal.com/>`__, some links on steam
punk stuff:

`steam punk magazine <http://www.steampunkmagazine.com/>`__

cool DIY SP projects. `steampunk
workshop <http://steampunkworkshop.com/>`__ and their
`keyboard <http://steampunkworkshop.com/keyboard.shtml>`__ that was all
the rage a few months ago.

`steampunk.com <http://www.steampunk.com/>`__, which I don't know very
well, but it looks like it would be worth exploring at some point.

And of course, `the wikipedia entry on the
subject <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk>`__

cheers!
