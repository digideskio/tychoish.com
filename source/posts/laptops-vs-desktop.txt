From a comment I made to `this
post <http://lifehacker.com/software/reader-poll/laptop-or-desktop-computer-301957.php>`__
on `lifehacker <http://lifehacker.com/>`__:

I have a laptop (powerbook 15 g4) and it's a great computer, and
despite it's age (2 years) it basically does everything I need it
to. And 90% of what I'm doing is:

- editing text files
- reading rss
- email/websurfing
- reading pdf files
- command line things

The portability is really helpful, but, frankly, I often feel like
I'm pulling around *too* much, and would like the computer that I
lug around with me to not have to have everything on it, and I think
that having a desktop to be able to manage the libraries database
(pictures, video, music, pdfs, etc.) could make a lot of things
easier. I mean truth be told, when I'm at home, all the computering
happens at a desk, so having a desktop wouldn't hinder things.

If you were just going to have one computer, given what the author
said, for a lot of people, particularly given how powerful a lot of
laptops are, it makes sense to get a laptop.

I'd add to this, that there are lots of situations where desktops
continue to make a lot of sense (other than production environments),
particularly where a computer is going to be used by more than one
person. That's something we don't tend to think about a lot these days,
but I think it's totally an issue.
