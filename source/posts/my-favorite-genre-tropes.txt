========================
My Favorite Genre Tropes
========================

I penned, recently the following (compound?) clause in one of my
projects: "my research program for the last 30 or more years."

You'll see what that's in reference to in a while, ultimately it's minor
and my aim with this passage is to cement the "book within a book"
feeling that I'm so fond of. But it also indicates that this character,
who is older, but still very able bodied (the narration is the result of
him taking a rather lengthy intra-solar system journey alone) I has had
an active academic/intellectual career focused on one subject for at
least 30 years. In point of fact, he's probably even a bit older than
that. Having characters that are older than they appear or would be in
our contemporary world is something that I'm pretty fond of. And it's
science fiction, so having a character that's pushing 200 is something
that isn't patently absurd.

This got me thinking to other things, namely, about the genre tropes
that I am fond of using in my stories. So here's a partial list:

- Space Opera. I like space opera because it's fun and enjoyable,
  because I know that readers "get it," but probably most importantly
  because it makes it possible to talk about political ideas and have
  interesting plots that aren't over complicated or grafted onto
  popular/contemporary notions of politics and history.

- Within space opera it's also possible to complicate plots in
  productive ways using various technological phenomena which might
  make stories difficult to tell in contemporary worlds? You need
  characters to be out of touch for a chapter? Relativity or a solar
  flare clears that up, sending your main character to the woods
  without a cellphone for the weekend, is kind of hackneyed.

- Globalization is changing the way that just about every group
  people on the planet interact with each other, and I think it's
  very true that this process is only going to continue, and there
  are situations common to space opera where it becomes possible to
  talk about cultural difference and divergence rather than
  convergence.

- I like to use telepathy and telepaths as a way of talking about
  privacy, and subjugated classes of people (on the assumption that if
  there are human telepaths, there are probably also humon-non
  telepaths.)

- I think relativistic time-travel effects are incredibly fascinating,
  and the Station Keeping stories are--at least in part--an exploration
  of what happens when these sorts of effects are normalized in a
  society.

- I totally have a soft spot for cyberpunk style virtual reality
  interfaces and direct neural interfaces, even though I don't expect
  that either of these are technologies that are likely to come to
  pass. VR makes it possible to toy with the mechanics of reality, and
  it makes it possible to have *awesome* battles/confrontations without
  needing to be contrived about it.

Now I think I should probably make a list of tropes that I don't really
get. Like super heros. Hmmm....

What are your favorite tropes? Have I forgotten a big one that you
really like? Are the tropes that you just don't get?

I look forward to hearing your responses.
