Hi folks. I'm in the thick of the semester and the general craziness.
It's not bad--I kind of like it--but it is stressful.

Anyway, I just have a quick note and a question for you, gentle readers.

1. Does anyone know of a **good** open source XML-RPC weblog editor. I
live and die by the one I currently use, but I'd like something with
better support for LiveJournal and del.icio.us and what not. I just
want something with a slightly faster development cycle. I'd also
rather enjoy something that was a little more mac-y. By Mac-y I mean
integrated and fast, I guess.

2. As some of you know I'm a big fan of NetNewsWire. This is an RSS/Atom
feed reader that is incredibly wonderful and very useful. I heard the
other day, that NNW **leads** the RSS reader market share by a large
margin. This is impressive because NNW is a Mac-only application.
Having said that, there are a couple of things that I constantly
yearn for. First of all, I'd like it to download images refrenced in
feeds for the last X number of entries, for better offline
performance. I'd also, like a better ability to password authenticate
for feeds.

So I came across a new feed reading application which addresses the
second problem, and is generally a cooler looking application. And the
new application is open-source, which I've become a big fan of. The
other thing about NNW is that it has an incredibly slow development
cycle. I'd like it to be a little faster to add features like delicious
posting (which it has, but it could do better in this respect), or
exporting of marked entries, or similar things. Or, here's something.
You can't subscribe to an RSS feed from NNWs built in browser! So the
other reader, Vienna, handles all my concerns, but isn't as fast (and
I'd have to run a perl scrip to import all my data from NNW, and I'm so
not that hard cor) Otherwise I'm so there.... If I were going to start
using a feed reader for the first time today, I would probably choose
Vienna. If you aren't as attached, I'd totally check it out.

Cheers, ty
