iPod Touch #2/Phone

So despite being a huge geek and pretty technically savvy, I'm not much
of a gadget person. I have a cellphone--but who doesn't these days, and
mine's 3 years old and seems to only barely have an address book--and an
iPod, but it's old reliable and not sexy. The `iPod
touch <http://tychoish.com/posts/ipod-touch-review/>`__ that I got as
part of a promotion when I got my new computer sits unused most of the
time.

The thing is, that my cell phone contract is (blessedly) up in March and
I'm beginning the long slow slug towards deciding what kind of phone I
should get. I'm slow on the decision making process, and I thought it'd
be a good idea to get started now. It's of particular interest because
my phone usage has changed dramatically recently. I've gone from using
it a few times a month to being on the phone for an hour or two most
days (and sometimes more.) And since I even have a
`calendar <http://tychoish.com/posts/calendar-ing/>`__ now, I think
something more robust is in order. Basically this boils down to
`iPhone <http://www.apple.com/iphone/>`__ or
`BlackBerry <http://www.blackberry.com/blackberrybold/>`__ (or `Google
Andriod <http://code.google.com/android/>`__). Admittedly this doesn't
really cut out any option other than the
`OpenMoko <http://www.openmoko.com/>`__ (which is ironically more
expensive and I don't think quite production ready.) We'll start with
the iPhone, vis a vis the ipod touch:

While I was initially optimistic that the iPod touch would become more
useful as applications matured, and people (myself included) developed
workflows that incorporated the device. As it turns out, I'm not sure
that this has really happened. Applications seem to be: well intentioned
but missing the extra-zing that would make them really amazing, or they
feel like some Suit said "iPhone app, we need one of those," and thus
they place more emphasis on the existing than on the being useful. And
I'm not going to lie, I haven't really adjusted to the virtual keyboard.
It's functional, but I think only barely. So while the iPhone is very
sexy, and the obvious choice, its not automatic.

Another anti-iPhone factor is that I'm generally avoidant about syncing
my iPods and tend to go months without syncing them, and I fear that
this might really cripple the the utility Particularly in a couple of
months when my iTunes library once again outgrows my hard drive. Oh, and
did I mention that I already have an iPod?

Right.

At the same time I'm pretty impressed with the upcoming `BlackBerry
Bold <http://www.blackberry.com/blackberrybold/>`__ Hardware keyboard,
an established platform, good hardware? Blackberry's can manage
background processes, and they have good XMPP/Jabber/IM email support,
which is, most of what I'd want to use an internet capable phone anyway.

I hadn't really considered the Google Android phones a viable player,
and I think largely they aren't. I don't suspect the hardware will be
*there* by March or April of 09, and while I like a lot of the idea
(from what I've seen) of Android, the truth is that I haven't seen much.
Maybe this is because I don't follow these things, but I think if I'm
worried about the ipod for not being developed enough, then that's going
to be an even bigger barrier for Android.

There's a long time between then and now, so this could all change.
Clearly I'm leaning BlackBerry, but I'd love to hear what you all are
using.

Onward and `Upward <http://criticalfutures.com>`__!
