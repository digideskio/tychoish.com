Tablet Interfaces and Intuition

I've been using `FBReaderJ <http://www.fbreader.org/FBReaderJ/>`__ to
read ``.epub`` files on my tablet recently, and I discovered a nitfty
feature: you can adjust the screen's brightness by dragging your finger
up or down the left side of the screen. Immediately this felt like
discovering a new keybinding or a new function in emacs that I'd been
wishing for a while time. Why, I thought, aren't there more tricks like
this?

The iPhone (and the iPad by extension) as well as Android make two major
advances over previous iterations of mobile technology. First, they're
robust enough to run "real" programs written in conventional programming
environment. Better development tools make for better applications and
more eager developers (which also makes for better applications.)
Second, the interfaces are designed to be used with fingers rather than
stylus (thanks to capacitive touch screens) and the design aesthetic
generally reflects minimalist values and simplicity. The mobile
applications of today's app stores would *not* work if they were
visually complex and had multi-tiered menus, and hard to activate
buttons.

The tension between these two features in these platforms makes it
difficult to slip nifty features into applications. Furthermore, th
economy of application market places does not create incentives for
developers to build tools with enduring functionality. The ``.epub``
reader I mentioned above is actually free software. [1]_ I write a
couple of posts a while back on innovation
(:doc:`:one </rhizome/where-innovation-happens-part-one>` and
:doc:`:two </rhizome/where-innovation-happens-part-two>`) that address the
relationship between free software and technological development but
that's beside the point.

Given this, there are two major directions that I see tablet interfaces
moving toward:

1. Tablet interfaces will slowly begin to acquire a more complete
gestural shorthand and cross-app vocabulary that will allow us to
become more effective users of this technology. Things like Sywpe are
part of this, but I think there are more.

2. There will be general purpose systems for tablets that partially or
wholly expect a keyboard, and then some sort of key-command system
will emerge. This follows from my thoughts in the "[[Is Android the
Future of Linux\|rhizome/is-android-the-future-of-linux]]?" post.

I fully expect that both lines of development can expand in parallel.

.. [1] I also found the base configuration of FBReader (for the
   tablet, at least) to be horrible, but with some tweaking, it's a
   great app.
