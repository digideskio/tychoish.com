writing and being read

I think this probably requires more treatment that I can give it now,
but here's a paragraph from an email I wrote last night, but here it is
anyway.

While I wouldn't turn down the option of a book deal that would let
me take a year of school/work to write a couple of novels, I don't
think I'm as keen on "becoming a published writer" as I used to be.
I just want people to read my stuff, and at the moment, the best way
for that to happen, as I figure it, is to be a blogger, someday, I
might look back to books as a way of doing that, but for right
now...
