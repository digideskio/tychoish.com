About a week ago, by your reading, I finished writing a short story. The
fact that I was writing a short story when I *should have been working
on the novel* is perhaps a bit distressing, but I've taken the opinion
that any work on short fiction--particularly short fiction where I'm
excited about the project and reasonably happy with the results--is
worth what ever attention and love I can spare for it.

So I took a break from my novel to write a short story. Most of my
attempts at short fiction are so abortive that I was hesitant to even
talk about it on the blog lest I jinx myself in some way.

But nevertheless, I got to a first draft. A first draft, that has an
ending which doesn't suck. This is a major accomplishment.

I'm not going to talk too much about it now, as it still has to pass
muster with my reviewers and get edited into something a bit less
rambling, but for right now I've chosen to take pleasure in the
acomplishment.

I will, however, say that the story is basically a compression of a lot
of the ideas in the novel I'm writing. The short story is set about
10-15 years before the story, but it has many of the same core
characters, and--I guess--reformulates the core issues in the novel's
story in a different context.

Oh, and it's a pretty cool space-adventure at the same time.

Because that's how I swing.
