Beacause I'm always behind on my blog reading, I didn't catch wind of
`danah's post-publication
reflection <http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2007/06/25/woah_omg_reflec.html>`__.
Fascinating.

I have to say that in addition to being interested in what she has to
say about the world, I think her position as an academic is incredibly
interesting: she's near the bottom of the pecking order, and yet, she
writes a (great) little essay and 90k people read it in the first couple
of days. I'm sure there are full professors in this world whose work
hasn't been read by that many people in their careers. Not to degrade
the value of that work, at all, just to say, that academic work != to
wide distribution in most cases, and similarly not to condemn danah for
being popular, I just think it's fascinating.
