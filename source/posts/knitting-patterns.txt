In the course of writing a computer program, engineers typically face
the same kinds problems again and again. As a result programmers have
developed a way of thinking about different kinds of solutions and
situations as "patterns," which provide generalized ways of talking
about common problems and strategies.

When I opened the editor to write this post, I wanted to write
something to connect this idea of a "pattern" with a knitting
pattern, which I think is (or could be) a very related concept.

Rather thank think about knitting designs as these static
instructions for constructing a single kind of garment, I think it
might be cool to think of knitting patterns in the sense that
programmers use the word: as a set of generalized responses to
various states and situations.

This isn't revolutionary. If you've been knitting seriously for more
than a couple of years, you probably already think about knitting in
this way. At the same time, knitting publishers organize information
in other ways: knitting "content" is either *design* and object
centric (how to knit a "thing,") or it's technique centric (how to
make a specific kind of "stitch" or "how to execute a specific kind of
operation.")

Patterns are good because they are guides to become more creative and
more resourceful knitters. Patterns help us understand how to
effectively use resources, to execute the objects that we want to
without dithering, and how to fix mistakes in our knitting when we
make them. Focusing on knitting "patterns," is not only important
because knitters will find them useful, but because it will advance
the state of the craft.

Patterns also help resolve an ongoing "problem" in the knitting world:
an online, `free culture <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_culture_movement>`_
repository of information about knitting.

In the decade or so, I've watched a number of knitters attempt to
create online information resources that serve as a free culture
repository for knitting. Nothing has been particularly successful, and
there's not a lot of "knitting free culture" out there.

While the lack of knitting free culture is due to a large number of
factors, the fact that knitting content has always centered on
"objects" and "techniques" is almost certainly a factor:

- objects are difficult to design, represent professional designer's
  only real way of generating a reputation and income, and it's
  difficult to divide the work of writing instructions for creating
  objects.

- there are a few (3-5) really, *really* good knitting techniques
  compendiums, and while new techniques emerge every now and then the
  books from 1938 (Mary Thomas') are as good as any of the more recent
  examples.

Patterns in this sense might be the best way to build an online
knitting resource.  Rather than store indexes upon indexes of cast on
methods, full patterns for garments, and stitch patterns, we could
create an index of knitting patterns, generated and indexed by
situation and purpose. Example patterns might include:

- Heels for Light Weight socks.
- Heels for thick socks.
- Crew neck collars.
- How to knit sweaters in the round when you don't want to steek.
- How to secure a steek if the yarn isn't wool.
- Knitting socks for high arches.

*And so forth...*

I'm going to use my (admittedly sporadic) knitting blogging to begin
capturing some of these knitting patterns. Then, if there's interest,
we can convert these into a more robust form.

Anyone interested?
