I didn't really have time to blog last night, I had to dash over to the
yarn store to drop off a sock as a demo for the class I'm going to be
teaching in a couple weeks. Its going to be **toe-up/stranded socks**,
if you're going to be in St. Louis, and you're interested. I'd love to
see you there.

Then I had dancing, as I always do on wednesdays, and this left me
feeling supremely beat. Hence no blogging. I did however post the first
in my `Better Living through Regular
Expressions <http://tychoish.com/posts/better-living-through-regular-expressions-a-dramatic-work/>`__
series/project. I did some regexp-ing at work yesterday, so I have
something to use as a pun for next week.

Knitting and all other things continue at an expected pace. Tonight, I
must must remember to write something theoretical for tomorrow at
tealart. And then I lookforward to getting some real writing time this
weekend. And knitting, boy do I need to get some knitting done.
