I'm not compleatly ready to push this to prime time, but everyone has a
story is another TealArt sub-website. Again it's the same code as the
knitting and (re)ping id but this 'site' will cover ideas concerning
narrative as a tool for exploring 'culture,' cognition, thought,
community, with a focus on queer and virtual communities. I'm
comendeering the old "Where We Ought to Be" category, and I intend for
this to be more of a collection of resources than any serious musing on
the subject. The wwotb story project isn't something I think I'm in the
right place to complete, but the underlying interest in narratives,
community, personal agency, and life history remains, so it seems
fitting. Stay tuned for more developments!
