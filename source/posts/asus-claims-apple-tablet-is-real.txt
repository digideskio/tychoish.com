`Asus Claims Apple Tablet Is
Real <http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/11/06/1327230&from=rss>`__:

Can Apple turn the Tablet PC into a success when previous attempts
have failed? The short answer is 'yes'. Any company that can make a
mobile phone with no buttons, no picture messaging, slow Web access
and no video capture into the most desirable phone on the planet can
easily make tablets popular.'"

(from `Slashdot <http://slashdot.org/>`__.)

I look forward to this device, but I think the point is pretty funny.

Meanwhile, *Zoe*, my trusty Tiger-running Powerbook G4, continues to
perform admirably, though the top plate on the lower left hand corner
continues to rattle worrisomely. The current plan is to wait until WWDC
and see what things are looking like then. I've toyed with the idea of
buying/building a beige boxed ubuntu "server," but *who knows*, things
work great the way they are, so I'm in no particular hurry. For the
record, I got Zoe (nee Mona Ramsey) in May of 2005.
