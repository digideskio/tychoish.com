Here's a good tip/hack for my quandary about backing up Mail.app email
messages into a text-based format outside of the Core Data database, as
part of my project of becoming less entangled with Mail.app.

A mostly unknown feature of Mail.app is its ability to export a
Mailbox into the everything-reads-it MBOX format. Perhaps it's the
glaring lack of an "Export Mailbox" menu option. But in true Apple
tradition, just drag your Mailbox to the folder on your drive that
you wish to export to. That's it.
