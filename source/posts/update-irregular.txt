I'm sorry that I've not posted here very much recently and also that the
links in this post will be pretty unadorned. I'll make up for it with
table of contents:

[[!toc startlevel=2 levels=3]]

Ok, so it's not much, but lets get started.

Discussions, Ongoing
--------------------

There's been discussion, and largely discussion that I've not attended
to as well as I would have liked. If you commented on any of these
posts, I've tried to respond in someway:

- [[pedagogy discussion\|pedagogy/discourse]]
- [[writing teaching
  discussion\|rhizome/teaching-writing-skills/discourse]]
- [[dropbox-replacements
  discussion\|rhizome/is-dropbox-the-mobile-file-system-standard/discourse]]
- [[wiki and collaborative fiction discussion\|rhizome/wiki-fiction]]
- [[vpn
  discussion\|rhizome/remote-accessibility-reverse-tunneling-super-dynamic-dns/discourse]]

New Posts
---------

While my posting volume has gone down, I have posted *something* since
the last update post.

- [[/rhizome/teaching-writing-skills]]
- [[/rhizome/is-dropbox-the-mobile-file-system-standard]]
- [[/rhizome/why-you-dont-want-programers-to-write-your-documentation]]
- [[/rhizome/remote-accessibility-reverse-tunneling-super-dynamic-dns]]

Rest assured that there's more stuff in the pipeline.

Funny Quotes and Submissions
----------------------------

For lack of a better place to put it, I've been collecting some funny
quotes from conversations with a friend of mine in the [[submissions]]
file here. For your amusement:

- [[submissions/hate-meetings]]
- [[submissions/not-clicking-that]]

If you have any funny exchanges of your own, or have some content that
you think I ought to see and you want to avoid sending me an email (*for
whatever reason*) the submissions bin is always open. And if you're
interested in a less-editorialized content keep an eye in that category.

Lost Posts
----------

For some reason, that I haven't figured out and don't really care to,
for a number of months, my posts from July of 2009 went missing. Usually
this wouldn't even be worth mentioning, except I July of 2009 was a big
month for me writing wise--I'd just moved to the east coast, I had my
first real tech job and my mind was full and I felt on fire. I consider
a couple of these posts to be "tychoish classics." The good news is I've
found them, so here they are:

- [[/rhizome/are-web-standards-broken]]
- [[/rhizome/distribution-habits-and-change]]
- [[/rhizome/fa-sol-la]]
- [[/rhizome/infrastructural-commerce]]
- [[/rhizome/multiple-computers-and-singular-systems]]
- [[/rhizome/my-workstation-choices]]
- [[/rhizome/new-workstation-trials]]
- [[/rhizome/on-package-management]]
- [[/rhizome/on-public-key-encryption-and-security]]
- [[/rhizome/org-mode-pitfalls]]
- [[/rhizome/personal-desktop]]
- [[/rhizome/personal-desktop-2]]
- [[/rhizome/stars-in-my-torchwood-pocket]]
- [[/rhizome/technology-as-infrastructure-act-one]]
- [[/rhizome/technology-as-infrastructure-act-two]]
- [[/rhizome/technology-as-infrastructure-act-three]]
- [[/rhizome/the-blog-is-dead-long-live-the-blog]]
- [[/rhizome/why-arch-linux-rocks]]

They seem to be arranged alphabetically rather than sequentially, Sorry
about that!

Contra Dancing Feature
----------------------

A contra dancing friend of mine solicited an email from me a few weeks
ago about a couple of contra related topics, which have worked their way
into posts that you can read below.

- `Part one: Gender
  Swaping <http://www.contrasyncretist.com/1/post/2011/10/contra-shenanigans-part-i-thoughts-on-dancing-the-other-role.html>`__
- `Part two: Improv
  Contra <http://www.contrasyncretist.com/1/post/2011/10/contra-shenanigans-part-ii-thoughts-on-chaosshenaniganswildfill-in-term-of-choice-here-sets.html>`__

The Internet is A Cool Place: Tablet/Cloud Computing
----------------------------------------------------

I found the following link on twitter from a few of my awesome (former)
coworkers. It's a blog post about a programmer who is using an iPad, a
remote server, and a computer to do all of his work. `read
more <http://yieldthought.com/post/12239282034/swapped-my-macbook-for-an-ipad>`__

It's an interesting possibility, frankly and I could probably make the
shift easily enough if I wanted. Having said that, I feel like I'm a
little too sensitive to TCP/SSH hiccups and I feel weird throwing all of
my (potential?) productivity into something totally network dependent.

An Emacs Tip Interlude
----------------------

I picked up the following little bit of emacs configuration, that I
think is wicked cool. It removes some of the limitations on m
mini-buffers, which gives them a lot of pretty cool features. It seemed
like the kind of configuration that I should have known about and
didn't, so maybe some of you don't know either.

   (setq enable-recursive-minibuffers t)

Git, not Hypertext, Is the tool by which we experience becoming Nomad
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not entirely sure why I'm following `Stephen
Ramsay <http://twitter.com/sramsay/>`__ on twitter, but I am. The other
day I saw the following exchange, and I feel like it's worth recording:

::

   <sramsay> Back in the day, it was fashionable to say that hypertext
     enacted certain theories associated with postmodernism (Deleuze, etc.)
   <sramsay> We had it totally wrong.  *Git* is the tool
     by which we experience becoming nomad.

I love this idea, and I've been saying variants of this for a while, but
it's nice to get reinforcements. At the same I think it's possible to
easy to loose sight of how git is *actually* used of git when focusing
on its transformative aspects. Which makes the theory read a little more
hollow.

Onward and Upward!
