writing in org mode
===================

With all luck, I'll have most of a draft of the short story I've been
working on done by the time this goes live, but if not certainly rather
soon there after. This is an exciting announcement in and of itself, but
perhaps the more interesting thing is that in the process of doing this
I sank into writing this story in `org
mode <http://www.orgmode.org/>`__.

My general M.O. for writing for the last several years has just been to
write and store the files in
`markdown <http://www.daringfireball.com/projects/markdown/>`__ and use
whatever text editor I fancy. I write the blog this way, I write papers
this way. Everything seems to work fine, there are converters for LaTeX,
HTML, and the plain text format is absolutely and completely readable to
people who aren't as obsessive about text files as I am.

While I'm a huge org-mode proponent, I don't tend to think that org-mode
makes a particularly good writing environment (or haven't, heretofore)
because unless you use org-mode org files are sometimes a bit ugly, and
the syntax is enough different from markdown to confuse me, and...

The general consensus, that I've seen is that while org-mode is indeed a
great boon to the intensive-emacs user, that it's not an ideal
production editing environment.
`muse-mode <http://mwolson.org/projects/EmacsMuse.html>`__, or my
favored `markdown-mode <http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/>`__
might be better if you're actually *writing text*.

And then, as I got into the writing of this story, I realized that I was
flipping rather seriously (and annoyingly) between my notes for the
story and the story I was writing. Also, when I'm writing book-length
(or conceptually book-length) work, I tend to break up the text into
more manageable chapter-length or scene-length files, which is
conceptually useful for me.

In a short story, it didn't seem to make sense to break things up into
more than one file, and after I'd written a couple thousand words, I
realized that something needed to be done. I created a file, with some
header meta-data (using the yaml form that
`jekyll <http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll>`__), an org-mode statement to
define custom-status words that seem relevant to the writing/editing
process, and then first level headers define key scenes or breaks in the
story. I've never written (or read, to the best of my memory) a story
that required more than one level of organization (but ymmv), and
then--and this is the clever part as far as I'm concerned--property
drawers for notes about what happens in the scene.

Property drawers stay folded by default, and are intended to store a
collection of key-value pairs, *but* they don't get exported by default,
and so are a good way to keep your notes and your writing together and
then export, as needed when drafting is done.

Also, I've recently added the following to my key-binding list, which
adds a property drawer to the current heading, which is indeed a good
thing:

::

(global-set-key "\M-p" 'org-insert-property-drawer)

I've posted a copy of `my template
file <http://criticalfutures.com/enclosures/template-story.org>`__ for
your review and edification.
