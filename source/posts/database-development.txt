This post is the spiritual sequal to `my (slight) diatribe against
database powered
websites <http://tychoish.com/posts/against-database-powered-websites>`__
of a few weeks ago. And a continuation of `my thoughts regarding the
acquisition of Sun Microsystems by
Oracle <http://tychoish.com/posts/coops-competition-openness>`__. Just
to add a quick subtitle: Oracle is a huge vendor of database software,
and about 18 months ago (? or so) Sun acquired mySQL which is the
largest and most successful open-source competitor to Oracle's products.

With all this swirling around in my head I've been thinking about the
future of database technology. *Like ya'do...*

For many years, 15 at least, relational database systems (rdbms') have
ruled without much opposition. This is where Oracle has succeeded, and
mySQL is an example of this kind of system, and on the whole they
accomplish what they set out to do very well.

The issue, and this is what I touched on the last time around, is that
these kinds of systems don't "bend" well, which is to say, if you have a
system that needs flexibility, or that is storing a lot of dissimilar
sorts of data, the relational database model stops making a lot of
sense. Relational databases are big collections of connected tabular
data and unless the data is regular and easily tabulated... it's a big
mess.

So we're starting to see things like
`CouchDB <http://couchdb.apache.org/>`__, google's `big
table <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigTable>`__, `Etoile's
CoreObject <http://etoileos.com/etoile/>`__
`MonetDB <http://www.monetdb.nl/>`__ that manage data, but in a much
more flexible and potentially multi-dimensional way. Which is good when
you need to merge dissimilar kinds of data.

So I can tell the winds are blowing in a new direction, but this is very
much outside of the boundaries of my area of expertice or familiarity.
This leads me to two obvious conclusions

1. **For people in the know:** What's happening with database engines,
and the software that is built upon these database systems. I suspect
there's always going to be a certain measure of legacy data around,
and developers who are used to developing against RBDMS' aren't going
to let go of that easily.

At the same time, there's a lot of rumbling that suggests that something
new is going to happen. Does anyone have a sense of where that's going?

2. **For people who lost me at when I said the word database:** In a lot
of ways, I think this has a huge impact on how we use computers and
what technology is able to do in the near term. Computers are really
powerful today. In the nineties the revolution in computing was that
hardware was vastly more powerful than it had been before; in the
aughts it became cheaper. In the teens--I'd wager--it'll become more
useful, and the evolution of database systems is an incredibly huge
part of this next phase of development.
