Ways I've Injured Myself Recently
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The tip of my right index finger caring a server.

2. My left knee (recurrent, minor) dancing, probably jumping. Design
flaw, I'm convinced.

3. I have some sort of strain/dislocation of the first knuckle of my
right ring finger, and its oddly sore.

4. My right shoulder, because I sleep on it funny.

5. My left wrist is occasionally stiff from typing and what not, but I
think it's sort of interesting that these 3 of the five hand-related.

Things I would Change about my Cell Phone if I could.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. I would be able to SSH into my cell phone, for the purpose of sending
libnotify-esque notifications to the cell phone

2. It would have a plethora of hardware keys, potentially some sort of
keyboard (on a slider) and only require touch-screen interfaces when
intuitive.

3. I would want it to run emacs, at least to be able to check on things.

4. I would like some sort of native terminal client on the cellphone.

5. It would be unlocked.

Objects that I would like to Combine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. eBook reader/music player/tablet-or-pocket computer.

2. A tea kettle and yogurt maker.

3. My network router and my computer.

4. A keyboard and desk chair.

5. The mouse (and my computer's dependence on it) and /dev/null

Things I wish I spent more time doing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Knitting

2. Reading

3. Editing things I've written

4. Spinning

5. Being social

Abilities of which I am Jealous in Others
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Musical talent, mostly playing the violin/viola and melodian.

2. Signing and leading songs effectively (including remembering lyrics
completely).

3. The facility to function on much less sleep than I seem to require.

4. The appetite to drink coffee without wanting to wretch.

5. The ability to write computer programs with skill and grace.
