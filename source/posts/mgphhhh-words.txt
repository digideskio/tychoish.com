- I'm so tired of introspection. I'd like to be able to just not think
  for a while.

- Def. Visiting *WesternState* in a while. Feeling good about my
  chances, hoping, of course, that I end up with chance to make a
  choice about grad school rather than being simply "stuck" with one
  school. Not that I didn't apply all to schools that were a great fit,
  and that I'd be willing to attend... but...

- Pretty sure about dropping this class I'm in, if nothing else,
  because my gut is saying that. Gotta think harder about whats going
  on.

- I typed something off hand in `this
  post <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/process/>`__ that has me sort of
  down about the novel project. Not bad, but I'm going to use time this
  weekend to regroup. But I think that just goes to show you *how much
  of an extrovert* I am.

- I have plans to clean my office this weekend.

- I have plans to come up with some sort of schedule to budget time in
  the upcoming weeks. Including: job search time, email time, reading
  time, writing time, blogging time, and knitting time.

- I'm going to make a commitment to read both science fiction, and
  academic articles in my field, because I enjoy them, because it's
  good for me to do that, because reading research articles, also I
  think informs my fiction writing.

- One of the reasons I'm thinking of dropping the class is that as I
  was sitting there, in addition to thinking "g-d I really don't
  want to be here," I was also thinking about how I could recycle
  one of my stock papers for this class, and that's not productive
  for me or for anyone. This starts immediately.

- I never checked to see what my grades were from last semester. We'll
  call them Schrodinger's Grades. Not that I'm worried, more that I'm
  just meh.

- I got some knitting time to myself tonight. Feels good, need to get
  some resolution on my current project, and also get my lace piece, as
  crazy as it is, into a more comfortable place. If I find out that it
  isn't ever really going to have a rhythm, this might become one of
  those long term, multi-year projects. Or I might save it for the
  summer.
