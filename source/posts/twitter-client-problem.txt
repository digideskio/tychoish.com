twitter client problem
======================

I need a better twitter client program.

I've lost some twitters with twitterific, as much as I want to like that
program.

But I think the larger issue is that I need to consolidate the behemoth
that is my IM list. It's scary.

I haven't been as productive this morning as I would have liked (but we
have good metrics systems on the sites now), but I'm in good shape for
the future, and this is in the end a good thing.
