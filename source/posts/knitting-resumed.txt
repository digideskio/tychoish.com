So I've started knitting again.

Shocking.

I've not been knitting very much in recent months, because I've had less
time, because I've been focusing my energy on other projects: keeping my
head above water, writing, dancing, singing, etc. It's a shame too,
because knitting is a great deal of fun, it's pretty rewarding, and it's
something that I'm incredibly good at.

I suppose at one point there were a lot of knitters who read this blog,
but I suspect many of them don't so much any more. Anyway, I hope this
post won't alienate *everyone* who reads this.

First up, for some project review:

-  I have a cabled sweater in progress that I'm working on the first
sleeve at the moment. I'm afraid I'm going to run out of yarn (but I
have a plan!) and frankly cables have never really been "my thing,"
but this is the only thing that remains that I was working on when I
left the Midwest, so there's nostalgia and I do want to finish it.
The biggest problem, I think, is that unless I move north *a lot*,
I'm not going to live in a place where I can really wear something
like this.

-  I have a sweater in jumper-weight Shetland (i.e. fingering weight)
wool that I'm knitting for a friend. I have the collar and the
sleeves to do, but it's very plain and a very straightforward knit. I
just need to do it. This is probably the next thing on my list. It's
been on hiatus since May.

-  I'm making socks. As I write this, I have just completed a pair of
socks that I started in May. They're simple, and plain (which is how
my socks tend to be) using `Dyebolical
Yarn <http://www.etsy.com/shop/DyeabolicalYarns>`__. I also got to
use a set of `Blackthron
Needles <http://www.myfavoritethimble.com/Blackthornneedles.htm>`__
that my mother got for my birthday. Both are quite wonderful. I think
I've discovered how much knitting can be done on a commute, and I do
expect to do a lot more commute knitting, but I need to find a way to
balance knitting with writing and reading on the train. Perhaps some
sort of morning/night split.

Aside from finishing the socks and immediately casting another pair,
I've been doing a lot of "yarn stash" reorganization and trimming. This
last week or so I've gotten inspired to reevaluate all of the stuff that
I have to see what I really need in my life and what I'm just keeping
because it's there. I've been through my clothing, the book collection,
and the yarn.

Although I've done "stash culls" before I felt like my collection of
yarn had a lot of stuff in it that I got without any intention of a
project, or for any reason other than "I might like to make something
with it some day." I've never really been a knitter when I've had a real
budget for hobbies and entertainment, nor have I ever knitted at such a
moderate pace. So I made the decision to not keep yarn around just for
insulation, and just get the yarn that I really want to knit with rather
than what I feel like I ought to knit with because it's in the bin. It's
been quite liberating.

I'm also, as I sit knitting, thinking about the overlap between what I
do professionally (documenting technical solutions and systems
administration practices) and pattern writing for knitters.

There's a lot of overlap in how I write and think about both, enough to
inspire me to think about doing more knitting related writing. \*As if I
didn't have enough projects already.

In any case, I don't know that I'll blog regularly about knitting as I
continue to knit more, but it might come up from time to time. You have
been warned.

Onward and Upward!
