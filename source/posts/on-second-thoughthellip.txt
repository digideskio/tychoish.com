On Second Thought&#38;hellip;

So I just finished watching the second part of Angels in America:
Perestroika. My line has been, generally, that the first play is better
than the second one. Due to the fact that the second one answers
questions too eagerly, and there's some really wonky stuff, notably the
scenes in heaven, and the whole bit with Roy Cohn in hell. While we're
at it, the whole Ethel Rosenberg stuff was a bit far fetched.

Well HBO cut the Roy Cohn in hell scene, and I really liked how the
scene in heaven worked out. Ethel was still a little over done, but it
worked out more or less.

And I must say that the "answers" given, really aren't answers in the
aspect that they don't really provide real closure, they just say "it
isn't over yet, there's so much more to see." Which is totally true, and
satisfying. Maybe it's more satisfying because I know that in the 14
years since the end of the epilogue, 33 anti-retroviral drugs have been
developed, Ronald Ragan died a miserable death, and the world hasn't
ended yet, and there's a hell of a lot yet to see.

No mater how avoidant of conclusions I might be in my day-to-day
intellectual life, I *really do* like a good conclusion that makes me
smile and cry at the same time.

I guess that's something I have to keep working on.
