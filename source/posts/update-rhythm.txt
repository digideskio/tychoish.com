I wonder if, at some point, this constant state of overload and flux in
my world will begin to seem normal and I'll just adjust to that normal.
In the mean time, exciting things are happening and I'm not quite sure
of the best way to write about them. Perhaps soon. For now, I'm trying
to get better about updating more regularly and I have a bunch of links
of stuff that have happened on the wiki in the past couple of weeks that
I'd like to share. Here we go:

Discussion of Rhizomes
----------------------

[[jfm]] and I had a good
[[exchange\|/rhizome/ideology-and-systems-administration/discourse]]
about an old post that I wrote on "[[Ideology and Systems
Administration\|rhizome/ideology-and-systems-administration]]."
Basically the posts says, "systems administrators have a unique approach
to solving technological problems," and discussed the implications of
systems administrators background on technology development. I think our
clarifications were useful.

There are a couple of comments on my recent series on a
[[tag/productivity]]. First, I wrote a post about [[task planning and
creating task items\|rhizome/create-better-task-items]], and [[madalu]]
posted a [[comment\|/rhizome/create-better-task-items/discourse]].
Second, a number of us had an ongoing conversation on mobile
productivity in response to the "[[Mobile Productivity
Challenges\|rhizome/mobile-productivity-challenges]]" post
([[link\|/rhizome/mobile-productivity-challenges/discourse]],) that
touched on emacs (of course!) input, and context switching.

Site Tweaks
-----------

This is a pretty minor point, but I've been subtly tweaking the design a
little in the site. There are now links to the [[tag]]s page and the
[[site-map]] in the upper right hand corner. I've also made links to
as-of-yet-uncreated wiki pages red (according to wiki-convention.) I
think (and hope) that red links are easier to spot when they're red.
Feedback on the design would be most welcome. My goal is to make the
site welcoming, easy to use, and to minimize the amount of "fussiness."
It might be time for a full refresh, but feedback on the
subject might be good.

Critical Futures and Wiki Fiction
---------------------------------

As a build on top of my"[[Wiki Fiction\|rhizome/wiki-fiction]]" post,
I've moved the pages that had been located on the [[critical-futures]]
page to [[previous/critical-futures\|previous/critical-futures]].
Eventually the story will move to the *Critical Futures* domain, but
that's a bit down the road. Right now I'd rather focus my time/energy on
writing some stories, for now (on this wiki.) Infrastructure can come
next.

I hope to work on a series of posts that explore collaborative fiction
organizing over the next few weeks. If people are interested, that is.

External Links
--------------

I came across a blog from the
[[comments\|/rhizome/make-emacs-better/discourse]] on the [[make emacs
better\|rhizome/make-emacs-better]] post that I wanted to offer as a
link `The Babbage Files <http://babbagefiles.blogspot.com/>`__ is a
great cyborg/emacs/free software blog.

This is probably not news to anyone, but from `John
Wiegley <http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/JohnWiegley>`__ I learned about
the following two emacs gems that merit mention:

- `paredit <http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit>`__ which makes
  handling all of the parentheses in Lisp coding much easier.
- `redshank <http://www.foldr.org/~michaelw/emacs/redshank/>`__, which
  basically adds a number of tempting systems and associated tools for

And in another direction, I've been playing with
`pylookup <https://github.com/tsgates/pylookup>`__. This emacs add on
makes it possible to access python documentation from within emacs, from
a local copy. The interface is a little bit fiddly but it's pretty much
heaven. More things should work like this.

Onward and Upward!
