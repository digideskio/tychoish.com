Title: Listing Instead of Blogging

Ok, so with `TealArt <http://tychoish.com>`__ broken for the present
interval, (they say it should be working soon, but who knows,) [1]_ I'm
going to turn back to blogging here. It's interesting, the lack of the
blog, or at least the possibility of having a blog around drove me kind
of batty. And frankly sucked some of the wind out of the launch, such as
it was, of `tychoish.com <http://tychoish.com>`__.

In lieu of a proper blog entry I present to you a list.

- I continue to be quite enamored of
  `TextMate <http://macromates.com/>`__. It's like *the* app to
  beat/use. Someday I'd like to have a firmer grasp of vim, but for
  now. TM all the way.

- I sort of jury-rigged a script thing for work using a Macro (which
  suprisingly enough I'd never done) a (**very simple**) `regular
  expression <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>`__ and
  TextMate that saved me probably hours of my time. So I'm pretty
  happy.

- I need/want to find some way to set up and start using an off site
  `subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org/>`__ repository for all of
  my most important text files and what not. I have some learning to do
  on the subject, but this kind of things needs to happen.

- I'm running off to knitting camp on thursday, it's going to be
  *awesome*, and I'll try to blog about it. Here, if not on
  TealArt. [2]_

- I'm going to have a post on
  `Zimmermania <http://zimmermaniacs.blogspot.com/>`__ tomorrow
  morning.

- I had a really encouraging conversation with the editor of another
  group blog. I might be able to blather somewhere else soon!

- I'm starting to get into the zen of my job, and while I think its
  still a deeply weird experience that I suspect will provide plenty of
  writing material for the rest of my life. But that's how I tend to
  think of summer activities.
   
At this point in my writing of this list, TealArt has returned. I think
my plain is: put up my monday post with an adendum tonight, station
keeping tomorrow, knitting pictures on thursday, and Deleuze on friday,
and we'll return to our regularly scheduled program next week.

- I still want to write that Gatsby take off that I was thinking about
  last summer.

- My knitting for this weekend is almost done. The bottom part of a
  sleeve (the faster part), another 2 rounds on the body of a sweater,
  and some work on an all new sweater just for fun.

- I've realized that very shortly I'm going to have a lot of sleeves to
  knit. I hate knitting sleeves in the summer.

- I remain pretty freaked out about next year, and what with it being
  july, I think that I need to focus more on this. Sigh. Denial is
  kicking out.

- We'll be in touch, I'll be blogging throughout tomorrow.

.. [1] Frankly I think it's kind of weird that tychoish.com works and
   tealart.com doesn't. There's not a lot of good reason as to why this
   should be the case. Nevertheless, I will take what I can get.

.. [2] If any of you are worried that my acquisition of another domain will
   in some way affect my participation in TealArt, fear not, its being
   down is a definite drain, and I'm very anxious to get it back.
