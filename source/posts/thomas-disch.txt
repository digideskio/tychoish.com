I only learned early this morning that Tom Disch had killed himself
July 4 in his New York City apartment....

Suicide is always, I think, something of a mystery. Even when
someone is in poor health, in bereavement, feeling isolated, we
still say Why? How could he end his life, be so sure that nothing
would improve? Things always change over time. Tom was only 68.

I don't know the answers to those questions for Tom Disch. I only
know that the SF field has lost a major talent, one of our own.

I didn't really know his work, but he's been on my list of things to
read for some time. My internal database on him pegs him as the sort of
"less pornographic Delany, with a greater tendency toward 'dark
material.'" That's woefully insufficient. I'll get on remedying this
file.

I do remember that I've been nagging H. to read his stuff because I
think she'd like it. I'm oddly struck by this, because although I didn't
know him, and haven't been as familiar with his work as I'd like to be,
I completely concur with Nancy Kress' final sentiment.
