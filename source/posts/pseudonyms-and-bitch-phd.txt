`Bitch, Ph.D. on
Pseudonyms <http://long18th.wordpress.com/2007/02/01/tedra-osell-aka-bitch-phd-on-the-uses-of-pseudonyms/>`__:

Pseudonyms prevent texts from being impersonal, from pretending to
objectivity; they draw attention to the author's role in a way that
a straight author does not. At the same time, though, pseudonyms
make a text more fully public: by hiding the author's identity, the
author becomes potentially anyone. Pseudonyms mean something, and
one of the things they mean is that the pseudonymous writer has a
reason for pseudonymity. When pseudonymity becomes a generic
feature, as with essay periodicals and blogs, one of the things that
means is that the genre entails risk, that publishing is risky.

(from `The Long 18th <http://long18th.wordpress.com/>`__.)

The essay is great to read, I have to say, even though it's probably
almost a year old. *tychoish* brings a whole new meaning to the term
"late breaking," alas. The particular quote about the role of
pseudonyms, is I think really great, and I hope to be able to
quote/refrence it again in the future.
