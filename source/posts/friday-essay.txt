Friday Essay

Hello friends, it's good to talk with you.

I've had a week that that can only be described as weird. I once again,
put off writing my friday Deleuze essay until Thursday night, which was
predicated on the assumption that I'd get some free time during the week
to read it, not to mention the fact that I'd be able to deal with
focused thought by this point in the week.... Alas I'm not.

However, after drafting 74 words of pathetic blogging, I realized that I
wrote, last weekend, a post for today. Aren't I the prepared blogger?
Ok, guilt-fest over, I'll post that this afternoon, although I will note
that I promised, in that essay, to write a post later that day. In the
project of total honesty, I'll not edit that out. I will, however, write
a few notes that I've been thinking about and pondering this week.
Because really, bulleted list blogging is really awesome.

-  I'm doing the radio show on Sunday morning from 10 am to Noon on
`KDHX <http://www.kdhx.org>`__ FM 88.1 in St. Louis. I had hoped to
play an episode of one of my favorite fiction pod-casts, but I
haven't heard back from him. Luckily I have the next three weeks, so
maybe it'll come through. In any case, I'm planning on playing side
one of `Jethro Tull's Thick as a
Brick <http://www.amazon.com/Thick-As-Brick-Jethro-Tull/dp/B00000AOUD>`__.
Because I can, damnit. You should listen, it streams and is archived
on line if you misss it.

-  I think part of the reason why I'm feeling so fried, is that thanks
to an eager undergrad, I was able to start working on different
projects at work. This meant that I could listen to podcasts again.
The downside, I did a lot of thinking, and apparently that's a
semi-finite resource. Note to self. Listen to more music. Also, while
I find many podcasts to be refreshing and inspiring, I **cannot**
listen to people talking and write or even plan things to write.

-  My moleskine, which I've been toting along with myself for some
months, is almost full, but not quite, but the spine is starting to
fall apart. I want to finish out to book before I start the new one,
but at the same time, I don't want it to fall apart, because I'd like
to keep the book, mostly intact for archival purposes. Also I'm kind
of excited that my new book, that I've had in store is a reporter
notebook (so bound like a steno pad) and doesn't have lines. The
left-handed guy in me really likes this prospect.)

-  I listened to one of Cory Doctorow's podcasts, which was his posting
of an interview that "`Oort
Cloud <http://www.oort-cloud.org/?q=node/310>`__\ " did with him, and
I quite enjoyed it. There are a few topics that I think I'll probably
be visiting here in the future. One, he was able to talk about false
consciousness in a straightforward and appropriate way, which was
delightful. Also he talked about habitualizing writing as opposed to
ritualizing it, and although his argument is pretty sound, I think
the example he gives isn't quite right, particularly in my case.

-  Also Cory talked about his method of podcasting, which is to use it
as a motivation to finish writing stories in a very barebones,
low-editing sort of way, which I think is still really good. Anyway,
this lit the podcasting bug under my ass, and while I don't quite
have the computer power to start at the moment, [1]_ at some point
I'll get my ass (and computer) into gear and get started.

-  I have a personal/theoretical piece planned out about how "gender" as
a location for analysis, for the kind of social science that I'm
interested in, doesn't quite work. While as I'm trying to explain
this argument, I've realized some interesting ways of approaching
this question, my main project in this planned essay was to explain
explore why I (and probably some of my cohort) came into college with
an interest in gender studies, but have left college with projects
that are related, clearly, but quite distinct.

-  I'm teaching a knitting class this Saturday. You probably don't care
much, but it meant that I had to write a rather extensive
pattern/instruction handout. While I quite enjoyed this writing, and
I think it will be a useful piece to have in reserve for future
projects, it was a lot of writing by anyone's standards, and
understandably that took a lot out of me. Ironically, though most of
my fiction and tealart writing time was sucked up by knitting, I
haven't gotten much time to knit; fortunately the knitting is helpful
in refreshing me, I find.

That's about all I have for today. I hope you enjoy, Talk to you soon.

Cheers, tycho

Frankly, my computer isn't really set up to deal with my email
database, let alone audio production. Or perhaps more exactly, my
computer can't cope with audio production tasks and cope with all the
other things that I need my computer to do all the time.
