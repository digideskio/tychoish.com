Hard is Good

In :doc:`the hard part of software </posts/the-hard-part-of-software>` you
could easily chose to read the word "hard" as "sucky," which makes it
seem like a big whine on the topic of "polishing your work is hard and
annoying," but really, that's unfair.

I think it's probably better to read the word "hard" as "important"
rather than "sucky".

While you may be able to get someone to try your software on the basis
of its core implementation or design, people *keep* using software
because it's reliable (i.e. "has tests") understandable (i.e. "has
documentation") and is easy to operate (i.e. "has a user interface.")

Furthermore, doing the hard work of adding infrastructure to a project
is what allows software to grow in awesome ways. When you do the hard
work, you make it possible to:

- add functionality and utility without needing to rewrite large
  amounts of code.

- add options and globules to expose features and behaviors in response
  to users needs.

Basically infrastructure begets agility.

.. *and don't you forget it!*
