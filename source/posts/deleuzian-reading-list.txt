Deleuzian Reading List

*I wrote this piece last Sunday for today, and then promptly forgot
about it. See today's other post for the reason why that the mentioned
post doesn't appear. Sorry for the weird ass blogging. Cheers, ty*

This week I got, from the library, a copy of *`The Sexual Self: The
Construction of Sexual
Scripts <http://www.amazon.com/Sexual-Self-Construction-Scripts/dp/0826515584>`__*
edited by Michael Kimmel, on the recommendation of my old advisor, and I
think I'm going to spend some of my "non-internets" [1]_ reading time on
this book. Also I'm sitting on *`Shorter Views: Queer Thoughts and the
Politics of the
Para-literary <http://www.amazon.com/Shorter-Views-Thoughts-Politics-Paraliterary/dp/0819563692/ref=sr_1_1/103-7241147-6496611?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1185110406&sr=1-1>`__*,
which I think I need to give some time to again.

My initial idea for the Friday Deleuze series was to make an
excuse-opportunity to read something that I wanted to read, that would
be helpful to have read, that would be fun, and that I probably wouldn't
read unless I had an excuse (like a TealArt post.) A while back I swore
off writing about my academic interests and projects because I wanted to
erect a slightly firmer boundary between work and play, and because I
didn't want to have to divide energy on those projects between the
"real," and blogging projects. I think not being in school at the moment
changes things a bit, but on the whole I'd like to maintain this divide,
even if it's illusory.

The other thing that I realized is that, I've written **8** installments
in this series, and perhaps I'm just running out of steam, given the
"trudging" that is generally required of this kind of reading, I'm not
sure that it makes the best second degree reading [2]_.

On the other hand, as small as my contribution to the TheoryBlogging
community is, I'm hesitant to give it up entirely. So I think formal
Deleuze blogging is probably going to go on break for a while while I
get caught up with myself.

For this week, I thought about doing a kind of "reverse" reading list,
rather than say "I want to read these books," this list would have
"questions that I want to answer." And while I like this issue, I can't
think of a TealArt appropriate way that would be intelligible by anyone
other than me. I think while I'm taking a break from *AO,* and before I
dive into *D&R*, I'm going to read some articles that I've had lying
around for a long time, and just see what happens.

See you later today.

In our household, we've taken to referring to the interminable
periods spent in front of the computer, reading
`RSS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)>`__ feeds and
other pieces of internet treasure, as "reading the internets, all of
them." My father, has even taken to referring to syndicated RSS items
as internets, leading to statements like "I have 43 more internets to
read."

and besides, who wants to read about someone else's trudging. "I
reads another chapter and it was interesting but unhelpful, and
probably laid the groundwork for something that's comming in the next
couple of pages, but it was mostly abstruse." I mean a lot of the
book is rather playful... but....
