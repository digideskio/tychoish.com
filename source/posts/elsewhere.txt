So, while it might *seem* like all I do on the interent is write `wordy
personal
narratives <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/future-knitting-project-ideas/>`__
or `lengthy informal
essays <http://tychoish.com/2008/09/open-source-freedom/>`__, I do in
fact visit other websites and participate in other discussions. Here are
a few recent tycho sightings and other bits of news (related to this
site):

- Most obviously, we have a new design and a new sub-blog, coda. I
  initially described it as a long-form twitter site. And it is. Right
  now there's a `syndication feed for
  coda <http://tychoish.com/feed/coda/>`__ (and a separate one for just
  the `essays <http://tychoish.com/feed/essay>`__), if this is more
  your speed. I'm not 100% happy with all of the display options, but
  this is a good start. I'd *really* like to know what you think, or if
  you find any bugs. At the moment I know about the archiving of the
  coda entries, and the inclusion some pages at the bottom of the coda
  display on some views. I'm also just assuming that it works on IE,
  because I don't have access to this browser, help (screenshots?)
  would be much appreciated.

- I've been working on updating and cleaning up the static pages of
  this site to make tychoish.com a little bit more of a website and a
  little bit less of a plain old blog. This includes a `contact
  page <http://tychoish.com/contact/>`__ and a `page about open
  source <http://tychoish.com/open-source/>`__. I also wrote up a
  "`support *critical
  futures* <http://criticalfutures.com/support/>`__\ " page. Working on
  more...

- In `Rewriting the
  Bases <http://www.aetataureate.com/2008/09/rewriting-the-bases/>`__,
  Caroline (who calls/links to me as sam because she's *that* good of a
  friend) outlines a mostly sarcastic commentary I made on gay male
  sexuality. I was mostly kidding, but I think it was sort of
  entertaining. Unfortunately, Caroline has used this as ammunition
  against my cynicism, making the claim that I do have a heart. Bah! ;)

- There's been a lot of ongoing debate in the SF blogosphere, about
  media-tie-in fiction. Like Star Wars and Star Trek books, which I
  remember fondly, but haven't mustered the will or the time to really
  get into recently (in part I think, because there's more lower grade
  stuff/stuff that isn't indented for the audience group I belong to
  now.) In any case, I commented on this at `jonathan Strahan's
  blog <http://www.jonathanstrahan.com.au/wp/2008/09/03/media-tie-in-fiction/>`__
  and on the `sf signal mind
  meld <http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/007130.html>`__.

- I've started posting a lot of the writing related stuff that I used
  to post here, over on my `sf writing
  list <http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SF-Writing/>`__, which is 8 years
  old now. Wow! Anyway, its generally sort of an interesting thing, and
  if you're prone to writing SF

- I've also started a more concerted effort to return to and become
  active in *the* `ravelry <http://www.ravelry.com/>`__ community. I'd
  lapsed for a while for a lot of reasons in addition to the great
  knitting malaise of 08, but also because I wasn't (and am still not)
  keeping my projects updated, and I don't much knit other people's
  patterns, and I'm boring/not hip enough in someways, but it's a great
  community, and it's good for me (and the blog) when I'm more active,
  so... I'm back.

More news as it develops.
