Yarn Needs and Progress and my Knitting Giants Talk.

There's a lot of things I could blog about: the dead squirrel in the
house, what I'm reading, the cool things I've found in my web serfings,
or a nifty reflection on Star Trek: The Next Generation but I won't. At
least not yet. I've made some key progress on a bunch of knitting
related projects, and I have some thoughts for you. So there.

I think I'm going to buy the number six ebony needles at some point,
anyway, though not this instant, as my next two worsted projects
are/will be on number fives, because I've already started the first one
(and its more directly from a pattern, and I know this will fit, so I'm
sticking with it) and the second one will be on fives because I intend
for it to be a jacket and I want something on a little tighter. After
that I have two projects on smaller needles (because the yarn is
thinner,) so its not a pressing issue.

I've started Faroe, and I'm really enjoying the sweater. Again. I lost
the pattern after knitting the first half of the first round. I was able
to remember the pattern from a year ago, and now have eight inches of
knitting completed. So there. I'm a modern day memory ninja. 4.5-ish
more till the gusset starts, and I will need the pattern for that,
because even I'm not that good.

I've been pondering for a while, how to finish the neck of this sweater.
One of the cool things about the sweater is that the neck has a pattern
and is hemmed. The other problem is that the neck is about two inches
high, which is way too high. Under more normal circumstances where
neck/collars are less of a design feature (usually some sort of ribbing)
its easy to just stop after an inch and a quarter or an inch and a half,
and be happy; however, in this design that's not possible, and with a
neck like that I fear that it might make the sweater almost unwearable.
Now I don't want that to happen, clearly, and I also don't want to wreck
the design by just knitting ribbing at the neck. Which leads me to the
following thought and my "Yarn Need."

Since the collar is hemmed, it strikes me that there's no reason that I
can't buy a ball of super nice black yarn (the sweater is black and
white) and knit the hem facing in it. And while I'm at it, I'd knit
facings for the cuffs as well. And since it's only one ball I think I
can go all out. My requirements are: soft (and silky) comfortable, not
too warm (no angora, for instance), black, and something close to
worsted weight. I'm thinking some combination of (merino) wool and/or
alpaca with silk or tencel. I thought about Debbie Bliss Alpaca Silk (DK
or regular, actually a bit on the bulky side might be alright), but that
might not be right. Also all the merino/tencel blends I've found have
been fingering weight, or just fiber, and I'm not keen on spinning this
myself. I've also thought about Frog Tree Alpaca, but I haven't seen
that in a while and don't remember it that well. I came across a skein
of the Bulky/Chunky, baby alpaca (in white alas), I've seen a couple of
different branding, but Plymouth seems to be the most common, that might
work. Any ideas? I'm all ears. Leave a comment or drop me an email.

In other news: I've broken the back of the first sleeve of the teal
tunic sweater, and should I feel particularly inspired (read: unlikely)
I might finish it tonight, If not soon. Usually home stretch knitting
inspiration is enough to carry me through the second sleeve, so the end
is defiantly in sight. I'm forcing myself to at least finish the Teal
Tunic before I start the next sweater (Turkish *Gul* (Rose)
Coat/Jacket), which I'm excited about. I spent a few moments a couple
days ago figuring out the numbers and pattern(s) for the sweater. It's
going to be fun.

And finally, I wanted to post a comment that I wrote for this entry in
Stephanie's blog. Stephanie asked for the three most influential
knitters. Here's my response:

I was just thinking of this the other day. Here are my thouhgts:

1. Elizabeth Zimmerman because without her, all of our (yours, mine,
this community, etc.) wouldn't have any foundation to think about
knitting as something that we could do *just for fun,* because she
made possible the contemporary sense of independent and creative
knitting. While others on this list have mentioned Meg Swansen, and
this is a nomination that I would gladly (and whole heartedly
support), except it would mean excluding another amazing knitter, and
given that Elizabeth is no longer around to come to dinner, I say let
Meg come as her proxy.

2. Alice Starmore. Alice has written the best patterns I've ever read,
and the only ones that I am, for some unknown reason, drawn to follow
without question. What I like most about Starmore's is that her
sweaters are complicated, difficult, but not undoable, and
unabasshedly so. Most designers these days seem to be attempting
tailoring or dresmaking with knitting needles, and I'm generally less
than impressed with the products. Starmore patterns, though clearly
not (all) traditional in the strictest sense, respond and interact
with a knitting tradition, and are sweaters, uniquely designed by a
knitter, and the patters shine as a result.

3. Pricillia Gibson-Roberts. The first two were no brainers, and I think
many knitters would say "starmore, zimmerman, and um, um, um...." in
search of another knitting giant perhaps of either a more
contemporary/popular (a la Nacy Bush, Sally Melvile, etc.) and while
I think they are very important to our contemporary understanding of
knitting (and indeed Nancy Bush, in particular has written a number
of books which I predict will provide the perfect stepping stone for
those knitters, converted in the recent fad--the frilly polyester
novelty scarf knitters turned felted bags/hats/etc knitters--to move
on to more complex things like color work, cables, and lace. But this
is merely a diversion.) Pricillia Gibson-Roberts, with some of the
best qualities of both Zimmerman and Starmore, doesn't give patterns
but teaches the skills neccessary to design patterns like the ones
that earned Starmore her place at the table.

So there!

Cheers, sam
