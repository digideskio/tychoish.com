This is Why I Hate Neurobiology:

So I was (mostly) minding my own business when, I saw the following
quote, in this article:

Trauma becomes neurobiologically etched and may be transmitted
across generations.

Ok For starters, no. Wrong. Try again.

Sure expereince (traumatic or otherwise) affects memory, and though we
don't really have a clue (well, I for sure don't, someone might, I
suppose) how the material realitieis of how memory is stored in the
brain, the term *neurobiologically etched* might represent this process,
whatever it may be.

Ok, that said: Memories aren't genetic. You can't transmit this across
generations.

Well you can. It's called telling stories, and it's a social, not a
biological process.

So there.
