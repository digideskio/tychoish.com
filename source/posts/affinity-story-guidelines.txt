Affinity Story Guidelines
=========================

I've started to make a list of guidelines for my Affinity story project.
It's by no means definitive, and subject to change/my whim at this
point, but I think this itÔøΩs helpful to my process, so here it is.

-  Contributors should be male, and have been raised as such.

-  Contributors should be gay, bisexual, and/or have had significant
romantic and/or sexual relationships with other men.

-  Stories should be factual, though it's ok to change minor details,
like names and locations to protect yourself and/or your
friends/family.

-  Stories should be written from the perspective of the author in the
first person.

-  Stories should tell of event(s), and feelings the author felt in
reaction to the events, and thus should not attempt to analyze the
event in a larger context.

-  Contributors need not have "come out," to their friends, family,
teachers, etc. confidentiality will be respected.

-  Contributors need not be 18. (*Is there some way that I can pull that
off? Also, is there a way that we can dodge the mandated reporter
bullet? I mean I don't think I have to report anything if I don't
want to, but I need to decide how I feel about this. I'd want to
encourage confidence in possible contributors that have stories about
cutting, abuse, etc?*)

-  How has being gay/bi has affected your friend type relationships?

-  How has coming out has affected existing relationships?

-  How dose your gay/bi identity affect your relationship to women?

-  Dating as a young gay/bi man?

-  How has being gay/bi affected school?

-  How has coming out affected your relationship with your parents?
Grandparents?

-  Have you ever come out and regretted it later?

-  How do you feel when you see a straight couple your age being
affectionate in public?

-  Have you gone to a Pride celebration? Why or Why not? If so what was
it like?

-  Examples that other gay men/youth have presented for you.

-  How has being bi affected a heterosexual relationship? A homosexual
one?

-  Gay role models.

-  Having a closeted relationship even if you were out.

-  Being in the closet, and staying in the closet.

-  Your feelings about the community of young gay/bi men.

Examples of subject matter for stories:

-  Your reaction upon meeting someone else that was gay (or lesbian).

-  The first time you identified with some one who was gay/bi and how
you felt.

-  How you felt when you met/saw/heard about the first (other) person in
your age group that was gay/bi.

-  A time an unexpected ally came to your defense, ie. A teacher
standing up for you. Conversely, the time when an expected ally (like
a best friend) didn't come to your defense.

-  How you felt when HIV/AIDS became **real** for you.

And basically this amounts to me thinking out loud on the 'blog, but
then I'm prone to doing that even under the best of circumstances. Now
all I have to do is synthesize this in to something a bit more coherent,
and more user friendly.
