I tell people that I'm a professional writer, but this is a bit
misleading, because what I *really* do is figure out how to organize
information so that it's useful and usable. Anyone, with sufficient
training and practice, can figure out how to convey simple facts in
plain language, but figuring out how to organize simple facts in plain
language into a coherent text is the more important part of my job and
work.

This post and the "[[Information
Debt\|technical-writing/information-debt]]" wiki page, begin to
address some of these the problem of information resource
maintenance, organization, and institutional practices with regards
to information and knowledge resources.

Organization is hard. Really hard. One of the challenges for digital
resources is that they lack all of the conventions of
:doc:`:/technical-writing/books`, which would seem to be freeing: you get
more space and you get the opportunity to do really flexible
categorization and organization things.

Great right?

Right.

Really flexible and powerful :doc:`taxonomic </technical-writing/taxonomy>`
systems, like tagging systems have a number of problems when applied to
large information resources:

- the relationship between the "scope" of the tag, and the specificity
  of the tag matters a lot. Too much. Problems arise when:

- tags are really specific, pages include a number of pieces of
  information, and tags can only map to pages.

- tags are general and the resources all address similar or related
  topics.

- the size of the tag "buckets" matters as well. If there are too many
  items with a tag, users will find not the tag for answering their
  questions.

- if your users or applications have added additional functionality
  using tags, tags begin to break as a useful taxonomic system. For
  example, if your system attaches actions to specific tags (i.e. send
  email alerts when content with a specific tag,) or if you use a
  regular notation to simulate a hierarchy, then editors begin adding
  content to tags, not for taxonomic reasons, but for workflow reasons
  or to trigger the system.

The resulting organization isn't useful from a textual perspective.

- If you have to have multiple tagging systems or namespaces.

  Using namespaces is powerful, and helps prevent collisions. At the
  same Sat Aug 16 10:50:00 2014, if your taxonomic system has
  collisions, this points to a larger problem.

- If the taxonomy ever has more than one term for a conceptual facet,
  then the tagging system is broken.

These problems tend to exacerbate as:

- the resource ages.

- the number of contributors grow.

There's this core paradox in tagging systems: *To tag content
effectively, you need a fix list of potential tags before you begin
tagging content, and you need to be very familiar with the corpus of
tagged content **before** beginning to tag content.*

And there's not much you can do to avoid it. To further complicate the
problem, it's essentially impossible to "redo" a taxonomic system for
sufficiently large resources given the time requirements for
reclassification and the fact that classification systems and processes
are difficult to automate.

The prevalence of tagging systems and the promises of easy, quick
taxonomic organization are hard to avoid and counteract. As part of the
fight against :doc:`information debt </technical-writing/information-debt>`
it's important to draw attention to the failure of broken taxonomy
systems. We need, as technical writers, information custodians, and
"knowledge workers," to develop approaches to organization that are easy
to implement and less likely to lead to huge amounts of information
debt.
