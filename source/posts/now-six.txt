Just the usual tycho garen journal post.

I went dancing last night. My parents run an--actually pretty
sizeable--dance group on mondays and I go from time to time, because the
people *don't suck*

Ok Rant about dance politics. There are dancers who read this so
feel free to comment. Generally dance groups have pretty sucky
interpersonal politics. Or at least all the ones I seem to have been
a part of recently, do. There's something about confusing the
kinetic connection of dance with actual sentiment, that brings out
the socially inept and emotionally stunted. Which is fine, if you
don't have to interact much outside of the dancing. But inevitably
you do, and it all bleeds into each other, because dancing is
intensely social. *sigh* Anyway. Clif notes versions, many groups
that I've been in recently/and am still in, suck: this one doesn't.

I thought I failed at shocking my sleep schedule a bit. I got some good
knitting done. My project is to move to a more 10:30-6:00 schedule. My
body really wants 7 hours of sleep, and I have a hard time pulling
myself up if I try and constrict it too much. A really hard time. The
post title refers to the fact that was able to only sleep six hours

So I'm just going to go with the flow and go to bed earlier.

I got a lot of knitting done last night. Which is good. Nothing
completed, of course, but these things happen. Again, pictures wouldn't
communicate very much new, so sorry. I'm working on a sleeve and a sock.

I also got some spinning done last night. I want to do some conventional
three-plying because I suck at Navajo plying, but for now I'm just going
to work on some two ply, until I get my wheel (which has been ordered).
And, there's nothing wrong with two ply, and I'm good at it. It's good
to be good at it.

I haven't been writing. Not even a lot of editing. Thanks, and welcome
to all the people from the `feminist science fiction
blog <http://blogs.feministsf.net/>`__.

I don't know what to say about that other than "I'm thinking about it."
And with luck, this too shall pass.
