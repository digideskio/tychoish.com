Given all of the [[recent changes\|changes-and-resetting]] in my life, I
found myself building and rebuilding a list of things that I'd like to
"in the future," sometime. The list is more than a set of mid-year "New
Years Resolutions," and it's not quite as impressive as a "5 Year Plan."
As a blogger with firmly ingrained habits, I feel compelled to share
this list with you:

1. Properly resume my knitting and spinning habit.

2. Read more veraciously. A book a month, plus the Asimov's subscription
   with which I've done a bad job of keeping current. And that's
   probably just a starting point. I have a backlog of things I want to
   read, there's new stuff that I want to read coming out all the time,
   and I'm not going to get that done without attending to it.

3. I'd like to refresh/redo the `cyborg
   institute <http://cyborginstitute.com>`__ site to reflect the reality
   of what I want to accomplish there, what I'm actually doing, and make
   it be updatable in a meaningful sort of way. I also want to get a
   number of project that I've been sitting on for a while together and
   published there. Those are:

  - The `ikiwiki <http://ikiwiki.info>`__ templates and configuration for
    tychoish.com.

  - A general purpose emacs "starter configuration," based on my
    configuration. It would be fairly simple to generate, but I want to
    write a build script so that I can keep it updated as I tweak my own
    configuration. I would also need to write some documentation.

  - Similarly, I would like to produce a basic configuration for
    `StumpWM <http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm/>`__ that would make it
    easier to use Stump.

- A couple of other specifications along the lines of the
  `Sygn <http://wiki.cyborginstitute.com/sygn/>`__.

4. I would like to start dancing regularly with a Morris Dance team.

5. I would like to reestablish a thrice-weekly non-dance exercise
   regime that includes some weight training.

6. I want to apply to go to Clarion. But not before 2013, and
   preferably before 2016.

7. I'd like to try learning to play melodeon for Morris, and maybe
   other tune good playing times.

8. I'd like to go to Camp FaSoLa in 2012 or 2013. I'm also a little
   interested in maybe learning how to key sacred harp. Maybe I've been
   singing too much tenor recently and found myself as one of the
   not-new basses more than a few times that I'm getting a bit more
   confident.

9. I'd like to finish this damn novel sometime soon, revise the first
   bit into a passable short story, and begin shopping the story
   around.

10. I'd like to try writing short stories for a little while. But I also
    want to revise Knowing Mars, finish Station Keeping in some form,
    and potentially figure out a way to make the other open/lingering
    story on my plate become Knowing Mars, Part 2.

11. Write more regularly here. I think about a lot of things that I
    think are interesting, and writing ideas and asking questions is
    really the only way to make progress on scholarly, intellectual,
    and/or creative projects. I'm aware of a lot of potential in this
    work on tychoish.com, and I'd like to be able to make significant
    progress.
