3 Odd Properties of Blogging

Blogs are *really* awesome, and blogs are also really powerful tools for
publishing and communication, and more than anything represent the world
wide web "coming into its own." In recognition of this, it seems that
everyone whose interested in the internet is out there trying to "crack"
blogging and understand what makes for a really great blog, and if you
listen to them, they'll tell you about how successful blogging requires
a solid niche focus, dynamic content (including videos, audio, and
pictures), strong clear headlines with interesting hooks, regular
posting, and keyword optimized content.

*Or something.*

Actually all those suggestions above sound pretty clever, but to be
honest, I'm not sure that those suggestions are really particularly
likely to lead someone who "wants to be a more successful blogger," to
actually, you know, be a more successful blogger. So because I'm one of
those folks who's interested in the internet and I'm trying to "crack"
blogging, I'll offer a short list of three things that I think make a
big difference in "blogging success." *Whatever that means.*

1. **Location matters:** I'd wager that the most successful blogs in
America are written by people who live in New York City or San
Fransisco, with a small but respectable minority of successful blogs
being generated out of: Washington DC, Chicago, and Los Angeles. I
theorize that real life social networking remains very powerful on
the internet. People read blogs of people who they know, and the
blogs that they learn about from their friends, and all this happens
in "meatspace." If you don't live in one of these cities, either move
there, attend events in that city, or be *very* active in a relevant
local community.

2. **Relationships, are more important than audience:** Remember how in
high school composition class the teacher was always going on about
how you should "be mindful of your audience." Well you should, but
you should be more mindful of your relationship with your audience as
a blogger than you're likely to be in any other forum. Blogging is
about conversations, about saying "hey friends, what do you think
would happen if..." Work on building your relationships with people
who read your blog or who might read your blog, and that is likely
the greatest single impact on your readership.

3. **Volume is more important than brilliance:** Fundamentally blogging
is an experimental medium. It's more important that you post every
day and maybe get a post every week or two that you think is
brilliant and clever, than post one brilliant and clever thing every
week or two. There are of course exceptions to this, but as long as
you're *trying* to be brilliant it'll work. Every post can't be a
home run. The corollary to this is that, if your only effort toward
being a more successful blogger is posting regularly, that alone
isn't the key to success, but regular posting is part of almost every
successful blog.

So that's what I have for you. Thoughts?

Onward and Upward!
