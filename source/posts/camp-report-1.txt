Knitting camp. Where to start.

This is an analogy that will only make sense to the morris dancers in
the audience, but it's sort of like an ale, with more yarn and less
dancing (of course) and much less singing. It's the lack of singing that
I find most disconcerting actually.

This is the session that has history, out of all the sessions of this
camp. There are a few people who have been coming for 35 years, and many
people who have been coming for way more than 20 years. And that history
is something that's really important to a lot of people, and it's cool
to see that and be a part of it.

I've been knitting on the `latvian
dreaming <http://tychoish.com/tags/latvian-dreaming>`__, mostly and I
have two other projects lurking around that I will probably work on
today. A lot of people come to camp and start new projects and I think
that I'm unlikely to do that, because I need closure on my current
projects and, I don't have fully formed ideas of what I want to do next,
anyway.

I've tried four times to write a paragraph here and I have too much
flying through my head to make sense of that so here goes a list:

- There are so many famous and amazing knitters here. I'm a little star
struck, actually. And a couple of times had lengthy discussions with
them before I realized that I was talking to someone who's name I had
recognized in a book. And then, somewhat after the fact I learned
that `cookie a <http://www.cookiea.com/>`__ was "camp newbie sitting
across the table from me." Sigh.
- On top of all the other interesting discussions last night we had an
interesting conversation about social dynamics on the internet and
the knitternet.
- At 9pm last night, I got a pot of hot water and had a caffeine party.
It was good stuff. Unlike a Morris Dance Ale, it's all over by
midnight, which means it's possible to get an at least passable sleep
in, but I needed the extra kick to stay up for that. Because:
- The drive was intense. Not bad, but long and I really pushed pretty
hard. I'll post about the podcasts and other listening materials I
went through later...

Anyway I have so much to knit. I'm going to go take a shower and then go
down and get started with the day.

Onward and `Upward <http://criticalfutures.com>`__!

(ps. Just a program note/reminder: There's a new `critical
futures <http://www.criticalfuture.com>`__ story today. CF, is my daily
(science fiction) story blog. I'll blog over the weekend here, and cf
will return, as usual on Monday.)
