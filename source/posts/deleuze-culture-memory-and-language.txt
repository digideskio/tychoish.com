Deleuze: Culture, Memory, and Language
======================================

It's Friday, which means it's time for some reflections on the work of
french post-structuralists Deleuze and Guatteri in the book
*Anti-Oedipus*. Good summer reading to send you off into the weekend.
Fortunately, having touched on their conception of "desiring/production
and machines," and bit on "anti-oedipalism," we can move on to something
*fun*. This week: I have for us a few passages from the third major
division about the emergence of language and cultural memory. For a
while I've been convinced that semiotics and linguistic theory is sort
of the cohesive glue behind post-structuralism, maybe it's because I've
been spending too much time with literary-types, but I think there's
something there. Also, I think if we understand things in linguistic
terms, it makes it (more) posssible for me to interact and apply these
theories. But anyway, on to the passages:

(Oedipus) implies an individual overinvestment of the organ to
compensate for it's collective disinvestment. That is why the
commentators most favorable to the universality of Oedipus recognize
nonetheless that one does not encounter in primitive socieities any
of the mechanisms or any of the attitudes that make it a reality in
our society. No superego, no guilt. No identification of a specific
ego with global persons--but group identifications that are always
partial following the compact agglutinated series of ancestors, and
the fragmented series of companions and cousins" (143-4).

I admit that I tried to rescue that passage from yammering on about
Oedipus' ultimate anality, and I fear it doesn't make sense. They say
that "our modern societies have [...] undertaken a vast privatization of
the organs, which corresponds to the decoding of flows hat have become
abstract" (143). That society, in particular modernity, has limited the
way we interact with bodies [1]_, and that this correlates with the way
we know and understand flows--desire. Because of these privatizations,
we "have" an understanding of Oedipus that is social, and one where they
are forced to ask "What then remains for the making of Oedipus?"

Moving back to our discussion of some concepts that are more connected
with the themes of lanague, that I'm more intersted in.

"the primitive territorial machine codes flows, invests organs, and
*marks bodies*" (144; emphasis added).

I understand this as saying, basically, that: from the very basis of the
formation of culture, desire, machines, and bodies are coded/shaped by
that culture. It's of course the "bodies" part that I find most
interesting, as this is sort of the part where culture and the
individual meet. Particularly in this moment, we're given to think that
our bodies are our own domains, and in some sort of twisted Cartesian
way, beyond the realm of cultural influence. Which is pattently false,
even if it's hard to grasp; in any case, the crossing of the mind/body
and culture/individual boundaries are I think fascinating moment.

So at this point we have a number of pieces: the culture peice, the
individuals/bodies piecs, lets continue this a bit further as they,
following Nietzsche, say: >"it is a matter of creating a memory for man;
and man who was constituted by means of an active faculty of forgetting
(*oubli*), by means of repression of biological memory, must create an
*other* memory, one that is collective, a memory of words (*paroles*)
and no longer a memory of things, a memory of signs and no longer of
effects. This organization, which traces its signs directly on the body,
constitutes a system of cruelty" (145-6; emphasis original)

Man, in the social sense "created" by representation, not necessarily in
our own memories of events but by a collective/group memmory. Not in the
"`groupthink <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink>`__\ " sense, but
rather in sense that through ritual, education, and practice what we
remember and know (as individuals) about "our" pasts is constrained by
cultural values and interests. Think about how we "remember" on
holidays, think about key cultural moments that you many not have
experienced directly, but are none-the-less part of y/our cultural
ethos. I suspect however that we're all more interested in the "cruelty"
that they speak of. They go on to say:

"Cruelty has nothing to do with some ill-defined or natural violence
that might be commissioned to explain the history of mankind;
cruelty is the movement of culture that is realized in bodies and
inscribed on them, belaboring them" (145).

And then:

"The sign is a position of desire; but the first sings are the
territorial signs that plant their flags in bodies. And if one wants
to call this inscription in naked flesh 'writing,' then it must be
said that *speech in fact presupposes writing,* and that it is this
cruel system of inscribed signs that renders man capable of
language, and gives him a memory of the spoken word" (145; emphasis
added).

Your thoughts? I'm not sure I can add much to that, but I'd love to hear
what you think.

best, tycho

organs being, body-machines, but I/we haven't quite gotten to the
grok point with Deleuze and Guatteri's concept of the "body without
organs."
