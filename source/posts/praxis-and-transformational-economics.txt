Here's another one for the "economics" collection of posts that I've
been working on for a while. Way back when, I started `this
series <http://tychoish.com/archive/cooperatives>`__ by thinking about
Kim Stanley Robinson's *Mars Trilogy* and by the model of economic
development presented in the final two books. In short economic activity
is organized around ~150 person co-operatives that people "buy into,"
and then work for as long as the co-op exists or until they sell their
spot so that they can work on a different project/co-op.

In the series, these co-operatives arose as part of a response to the
multi/trans/meta-national corporations which were the books antagonists.
Corporations which had grown so big, that they resembled nations as much
as they did companies in the contemporary perspective. The co-ops came
around in part as a response to the *metanat's*, but then the
corporations themselves restructured in response to an
ecological/sociological catastrophe, so that they eventually started to
look more like the cooperatives. The "progressive," meta-national
corporation was called "Praxis," in the stories and Praxis was the
organization that lead the transformation from metanational capitalism
to, what followed. As part of this series, I'd very much like to think
about Praxis and what kinds of lessons we can bring back from this
thought, beyond the simplistic "cooperatives good, corporations bad,"
notion that I've been toting for months. Thus,

-  The corruption and disconnect from authentic economic exchange in
that the metanats display in the Mars Books, far outclasses anything
that's happening today. On the one hand, given the nature of Science
Fictional criticism, this isn't such a great barrier to importing
ides from the books; on the other, we must also imagine that Praxis
is able to "out compete" traditional meta-nationals because of the
scale of the issue. That is, the Praxis critique and solution may be
valid today, but things may have to get much worse before a
Praxis-like solution becomes economically viable.

-  Praxis succeeds in the story, not because it can out compete the
meta-nationals at their own game, not because it's "right." I
appreciate fiction (and reality,) where the winning economic solution
wins on economic rather than moral terms. While I'm hardly a Market
proponent, it's hard to divorce economics from exchanges, and I think
the following logic fails to convince me: "we change current cultural
practice to do something less efficient that may create less value,
because it complies better with some specific and culturally
constrained ethic."

One part of my own thinking on this issue has revolved around looking
for `mechanisms that produce
change <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/revolutionary-communities>`__ and I
think Praxis is particularly interesting from a mechanistic perspective.

-  Praxis presents a case of a revolutionary-scale change, with
evolutionary mechanisms, which is something that I think is hard to
argue for, or encourage as the change itself is really a result of
\*everything else that's going on in the historical moment.
Nevertheless, everyone in the story world is very clear that
Praxis-post transformation is fundamentally not the same kind of
organization that it was before. In a lot of ways it becomes its own
"corporate successor state," and I think that leaves us with a pretty
interesting question to close with...

How do we setup and/or encourage successor institutions to the flawed
economic organizations/coroprations we have today without recapitulating
their flaws?
