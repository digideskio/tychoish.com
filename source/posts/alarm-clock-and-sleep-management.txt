Alarm Clock and Sleep Management
================================

I got a new alarm clock this week. Well new to me, at any rate. It's one
of those nifty ones that can wake you up with music from an iPod (and
charge it all at the same time). Truth is that, I've not even had a
clock in my bedroom for a number of months: I tend to wake pretty early
on my own/with cats, my coworkers aren't in my timezone anyway, and I
unplugged my old alarm clock because I needed the outlet, and never got
around to plugging it back in.

The experience of waking up to the alarm clock has been overwhelmingly
positive. I tend to get up regularly and earlier first and foremost.
This is a good thing, because I think I was slipping into the habit of
sleeping too much. And too much sleep--counter intuitively--can wreak
havoc on my energy levels and mood, so I've just felt better all around.
It makes sense that too much sleep can lead to decreased
mood/energy--your body gets used to sleeping more, and so it gets to
need sleep so you get tiered more--but your millage may vary.

The second great thing about this alarm clock, and the waking up to
music, rather than a buzzer is that I've found that I wake up more
"gently," that is, rather than being jarred awake by a buzzer, the music
comes on, and I drift towards wakefullness, I listen to a song or two
(if I like it) while I think about what the day holds and muster the
strength to get up. And then I'm up. I've found that when I get up, I'm
not groggy, and I'm generally ready to get started at the things that I
need to do.

How cool is that?

I think this whole "sleep management" thing is worth something. Sleep is
important, and having an unadjusted sleep schedule is never fun, but
I've realized that sleeping the "right" ammount is something that I have
to pay attention to. Maybe this is a product of our sleep rythms being a
little more than a day long, but who knows. My general sleep-related
goals are:

- Sleep a little less than I'm inclined to. Not by a lot, but 90
minutes or less seems to leave me feeling better.
- If I feel like I need to take a nap, I almost always try to do it for
sometime between 1-3 in the afternoon, which is when I'm the least
productive/creative anyway.
- This alarm clock, and "waking up softly" seems to be helpful.
- With the choice between being up in the morning and being up late at
night, I always chose the former.
- If I feel like I'm having trouble falling asleep, I ususally get up
and read or do something else. The end result isn't that I get more
sleep, and though tired I feel better the next day.
- I also try and time caffine intake so that it doesn't muck up my
sleep schedule, though the truth is that I can sleep through a
caffiene buzz if I'm tired enough. I tend to think of caffiene as a
having a "focusing" rather than an "alertness" effect. But that's
just me.

Anyone else think about their sleep like this? Generally? It has a big
effect on how I work and how I approach work, but I think it's probably
a little bit wierd. Anyway...

Onward and Upward!
