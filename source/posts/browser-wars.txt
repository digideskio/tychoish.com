Browser Survey

Long story, short punch line. I was developing a website the other day,
and I realized that I had to do some compatibility testing with other
browsers. While I have a webkit-based browser lying around for these
purposes I had to turn to `BroswerShots <http://www.browsershots.org>`__
to see what the site looked like in certain windows only browsers. this
lead me on something of a little mystery hunt.

I did some checking on my stats and I found that a majority of the
visitors to this site are firefox/mozilla (gecko users) and there's a
sizable minority that uses Webkit browsers (Safari/Chrome/Etc.). That
takes care of about 75% percent of you. The remaining portion uses
Internet Explorer (IE).

So be it, really, I mean, I'd try
`Chrome <http://www.google.com/chrome/>`__, or
`Firefox <http://www.firefox.com>`__ if you can, but the truth is that
by now IE 8 (and even 7) render pages more or less the way they should,
and I don't have a big gripe about that (which accounts for 3/4s of all
IE useage). There are, however, a quarter of the IE users (so 6% of
you,) that are using IE 6. Which actually, can't seem to render any
pages correctly, from what I can tell.

Since I already know what browsers you use the survey then should be:

- Why do you use the browser you use, particularly if its IE or IE 6

- Do you prefer a brwoser that's fast, but light on features (All
WebKit browsers henceforth deployed), or a slower but featured filled
browser (Firefox?)

- Are you trying to use your browser less than you currently do (taking
work offline,) or more (putting more things into the cloud)?

- What do you think the "next big thing in browsers is?"
