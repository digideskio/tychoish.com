Misreads and Mistyping

What do you call a Freudian Slip, if it happens when you're reading. A
Freudian Shuffle? Because I don't have the time or the energy to do
better at this point, here are two recent textual slips/shuffles that
I've made of late. I promise I'll be back with real content at some
point.

I was writing a paper about depression, but kept writing oppression
instead.

Just now, I was reading a blog that mentioned "Delay" (as in the former
house majority leader) which I totally read as "Dela**n**\ y," as in
Samuel R. Speaking of which, I need to add Delany material to my Amazon
Wish-list (which I'm not going to link to here out of taste, but you can
feel free to find it on your own.)

Cheers, Sam
