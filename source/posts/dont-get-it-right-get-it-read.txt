This post is mostly about things I've `read/am
reading <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/new-year/>`__, but I have a few
administrative issues to get out of the way first.

I'm `still up in the air about the new name or tagline for
tychoish <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/naming/>`__. I learned that I was
misremembering the "early days of a better nation quote," which make it
difficult to serve as a new blog title. "Work as if you were living--"
is kinda dumb, even if you modify it to "think" or "write." And I think
"innovated, bordering on the avate garde," is perhaps a smidge to close
to pornography for my tastes. Regarding the use of the pen
name/pseudonym, I realized in a comment exchange on LiveJournal [1]_
that the reason I was a bit angsty about this is that knitting is
something that I already do "as [given name]," and because of this and
because there is--as far as I know--not a huge precedent of knitters
using pen names I got bit tetchy about it. Now that I've realized these
things I feel fine about the situation.

But anyway, that said...

Back to reading:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a fit of insomnia, I finished reading Samuel Delany's "Empire Star,"
the novella that's related to *Babel-17*, that I read last year
(*Bable-17* is the closest thing there is to the "Science Fiction of
Lingustics" and is quite amazing [2]_). I've seen this novella
anthologized a number of times in "new space opera" and "SF classics"
collections, and it's absolutely amazing.

The plot is very complex and circularly, and perfectly simple all at the
same time. The use of the narrator is risky as hell from my perspective,
but it works perfectly. It's also, not surprisingly, an incredibly
self-aware text. It predicts when the story is going to become
interesting and turn, it's self-referential, and the responses to
"Empire Star" in *Babel-17* are **perfect.**

Good stuff.

I'm not sure what my next novel to read is going to be. I have Delany's
*Stars in my Pocket Like Grains of Sand* on the shelf, and I'd like to
read that at some point, but I think giving my brain a while to rest
might be good. I'm also considering reading Alfred Bester's *The
Demolished Man,* because I write telepath stories, am
interested/entertained by procedurals, and because I haven't, but I
don't know how that's going to go over.

I also got the *Left-Hand of Darkness,* which I've always wanted to read
(and even started a few times,) but something always manages to come up,
so maybe I should dive in to this.

I feel somewhat guilty by the fact that I'm not really getting into the
Tiptree (*The Stary Rift*,) but I think it's no use to guilt myself into
what is ostensibly pleasure reading.

I'm also beginning to listen to `James Patrick
Kelly's <http://www.jimkelly.net/>`__ reading of *Look into The
Sun,*\  [3]_ on his podcast "`Free
Reads <http://freereads.blogspot.com/>`__\ " [4]_, which proves to be
interesting and fun. It's nice to knit while listening to podcasts, and
I've been behind on my knitting of late.

Anyway, that's all I have on that. I'll be in touch.

Onward and Upward!

I
(`automatically <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/wordpress-livejournal-crossposting/>`__)
cross-post the content of this blog to a similarly titled live
journal, and the comments over there are open, so sometimes
discussions pop up over there. This is perhaps not ideal from the
reader's perspective, but I have opted to encourage more commenting
at the possible risk of fragmenting a discussion.

Actually, now that I think about it, Janet Kagen's original series
Star Trek novel "*Uhura's Song*\ " is also, kind of, lingustic SF.
*Uhura's Song* is, I'd argue, the best piece of liscenced science
fiction ever, and of at least minor importance to the field feminist
science fiction.

Which, is linked, thanks to my sleep deprived mind, to the title of a
morris tune called "Jump at the Sun." Sigh.

Given the above connection to the morris tune, you'll, I'm sure, be
pleased to know that I did *not* almost type "Free Reeds," though I
am forced to wonder how many accordion podcasts there are in the
world.
