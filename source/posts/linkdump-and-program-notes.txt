So I'm off in a few to go visit with my grandmother who has recent had a
knee replacement. (Indeed this means that the blog has been down one
reader for a few weeks--rehab centers not having wifi and all--and
likely will for another week and some change.) While there is high speed
internet (how do you think said grandmother reads the blog,) my posting
time might be a little bit sparse. [1]_

My goal is to post the first bread crumb of the `latvian
dreaming <http://tychoish.com/tag/latvian-dreaming/>`__ tonight.

I did want to share a couple of links that I've been collecting over the
past few days and weeks.

- `sockpr0n's schacht
  matchless <http://sockpr0n.blogspot.com/2008/03/bitten-by-my-schacht-matchless-and.html>`__
- This blog posting has some useful info on "hybrid" double drive
  setup, where you can do double drive with two separate bands rather
  than one band. This means you can have a finer degree of control over
  tension like you would with a break band, except with the evenness of
  double drive. Rock. On.
- `y knit <http://www.yknit.com/>`__ - I started listening to this as I
  was spinning with my mother this morning before getting ready to go.
  It's great. Perfect length, great guys (hi mike!), nice insight. I'm
  generally pretty nonplussed towards the Stitch and Bitch stuff (the
  "consumer feminism" wigs me out, as does the hipster stuff.) but
  hearing Debbie Stoller talk makes me like her more, even if the aura
  isn't something I"m into. I suspect I'm the *last* person to be
  getting into this (I'm generally 3 months behind on getting into new
  podcasts, at least), but if you're not listening to this one, work on
  it.
- `Tea Gadget <http://Www.WisdomWands.com>`__ - I got an email from the
  marketing department of this company, that makes this portable loose
  leaf tea brewing thing. I think the website might be an interesting
  place to start a semiotic study of advertising, and the contraption
  looks interesting. I'm not sure if it's right for me, but you might
  be different. I think getting this email either means that I've
  arrived, or I'm officially passed my prime.

Anyway. Looks like that's all the news that's fit to sing.

Brownie points to the first person to figure that one out. That isn't
family. ;)

Onward and Upward!

.. [1] Which of course means that I'll have lots of time to write and post 6
   entries this weekend. These things have been known to happen.
