I'm sure I've ranted about this r/evolution debate in the past, but
`this
post <http://www.boingboing.net/2008/01/15/bruce-sterlings-kios.html>`__
about Bruce Sterling's new novella in F&SF fired up my feelings on the
subject, so here it goes.

First off, let me establish that I'm going to use the term evolution
in an explicitly non-technical sense. I'm often annoyed that any
sort of gradual change or adapatation is refered to as "evolution,"
when in a technical sense, this isn't even a good analogy to what's
happening. But that's a different rant, for now I'm going submit to
the dominant lexicon.

Secondly, I haven't read Sterling's novella, and this isn't a
reaction as much to Sterling as it is to Cory Doctorow's gloss of
the Novella. Just to be clear.

From the blog post:

"Sterling says of this story, "I've been in an eight-year struggle
to write 'a kind of science fiction that could only be written in
the 21st century.' With the possible exception of my forthcoming
novel, this story is my best result from that effort." I think he's
right -- about the story, anyway; I haven't seen the novel yet."

This seems to be a false premise. At least to me. The 21st century is an
arbitrary unit, and while I think we **do** live in a very different
world today than we did eight or ten years ago, that is **always** the
case. Interestingly `boingboing <http://www.boingboing.net/>`__, gets a
lot of milage out of looking back at forward looking bits of "culture"
from the turn of the century, and the 20s-40s. These cultural artifacts
seem as antiquated to us as "the kind of science fiction that could only
be written in the 21st century," will surely look in the next dozen
years.

Which isn't to say it's the *wrong* thing to write, or *bad*, just that
if you look at it the right way, "writing SF that could only be written
in today's world," is exactly what **every** SF writer is (or should)
always already (be) trying to write. And if you've been in eight year
struggle to do this, maybe there some other issue that we should talk
about. But then authors of cyberpunk are all about arguing that the
present marks an revolutionary advancement from *whatever went before.*

Doctorow goes on to say:

"This is a genuinely 21st century piece of sf. It uses the slightly
stilted, comic dialog form of great sf to unravel the social and
technological implications of automated search, copying, governance
and communications, with an enormous amount of compassion and heart.
Sterling's way of thinking about technology has often struck me as
kind of stern, but years of living in Serbia appear to have given
him a bit of a melancholy Slavic outlook that creeps into the story
in a hundred little ways that tell you how much affection he really
has for our poor tired human race."

I fear that this mode of writing utterly current SF is really based on
some sort of ill gotten notion that if we write about the present we'll
be seen as being "more real," than if we write about space ships and
lasers. Which is all kinds of silly, and this sort of critical trend is
dangerous, because it doesn't promote a diversity of opinion and
approach. This is sort of a reenactment of the downfall of cyberpunk all
over again. Or maybe more correctly given that it's being propagated--at
least primarily--by Sterling and Gibson (and Doctorow, though he wasn't
publishing during the "high cyberpunk period"), part of the protracted
decent of that movement.

Don't get me wrong, I rather enjoy the concept of cyberpunk, and some of
the post-cyberpunk imaginations in much the way that I enjoy space
opera: as a platform for story telling that isn't necessarily true to
*what's going to happen,* but enjoyable and full of possibility
nonetheless. At the same time I think the argument that cyberpunk is
more real, and in touch with everyone's lived realities, because it is
gritty, and dark, and current is absurd.

And I think this goes back to the r/evolutionary argument: do we
understand history as a slow progression, or a series of distinct
epochs?

The question is open of course, but I tend to believe that revolutions,
of the intellectual/cultural/historical scope that cyberpunk seems to be
responding to, don't really happen. Other kinds of revolution? Maybe,
and if/when they do, they're never has temporally clear cut as *anyone*
would like them to be.

Sorry guys...

tycho out.

Onward and Upward!
