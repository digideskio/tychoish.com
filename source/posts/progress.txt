so, I've managed to get most of my work done on these [1]_ things,
including the last minute fiddling.

I like the way that this plugin works, and I've even managed to add
category archives in a way that I like. I suspect that I'll probably
slowly grow a TealArt template out this. we're long overdue for a
redesign, and frankly K2, the theme that we've been hacking is
irrevocably annoying.

I updated the `station keeping <http://tychoish.com/hanm>`__
documentation as well, and now all I have to do is actually write
something. But I foresee grilled eggplant in my future, so I'll probably
do that first.

you know, this isn't very tumble-log-y. I have yet to try a block quote,
though, that might help.

.. [1] **Update:** by which I mean the website, and this design.
