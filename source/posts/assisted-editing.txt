I learned about
`artbollocks-mode.el <http://robmyers.org/weblog/2011/10/08/artbollocks-modeel/>`__
from `Sacha Chua's
post <http://sachachua.com/blog/2011/12/emacs-artbollocks-mode-el-and-writing-more-clearly/>`__,
and it's pretty freaking amazing.

Basically, it does some processing of your writing--\ *while you
work*--to highlight passive sentences and affected jargon. [1]_ And
that's all. There are some functions for generating statistics about
your writing, but I find I don't use that functionality often. You can
enable it all of the time, or just turn it on when you're doing editing.

After a few weeks, I've noticed a marked improvement in the quality of
my output. I leave it on all the time, but I'm pretty good at resisting
the urge to edit while I'm writing. Or at least I'm pretty good at
picking up again after going back to tweak a wording. In general it's
hard to keep more than a few things in an editing pass at any time.

It turns out that the instant feedback on passive sentences, even though
it's not perfect, is *great* for improving the quality of my content the
first time out. And it's even better for doing editing work. It's harder
to ignore a passive sentence when the editor is highlighting you see a
screen full of them for you.

It's of course important to be able to ignore its suggestions from time
to time, and it's no harder to ignore than "flyspell-mode" (the
on-the-fly spell checker in emacs.)

This is perhaps the clumsiest part of the default distribution, as
jargon is terribly specific to the kind of writing you're doing, and
it turns out that one of the "art critic"/post-modern words (i.e.
"node") is a word that I end up using (acceptably, I think) in a
technical context when describing a clustered system. And there's a
difference between a technical lexicon and a jargon, and regular
expressions aren't terribly sensitive to this, so the actual list of
words that you need to call yourself out on, varies a bit from person
to person. But once you customize it, it's great.
