In lieu of an actual essay on this quasi-holiday, I have a funny
exchange from earlier in the week. Continue to have a good holiday, and
I'll see you on Monday.

--------------

**tycho:** so I was thinking about getting an old(er) ThinkPad x41
tablet and linuxifying it, so I'd have a linux portable and we'd have
another computer around here because most of the computers in the house
are older and the last time an old computer went south, there was major
familial strife.

**chris:** ah which is the x41

**tycho:** [*passes a link*\ ]

**chris:** you really do obsess over some of the strangest hardware.
It's kinda slow and old.

**tycho:** it runs emacs and stuff, it should do fine.

**chris:** trufax. I forget little you demand of your computers. Why
would you want a tablet though?

**tycho:** reading stuff.

**chris:** I just don't see the point of sacrificing performance for a
nebulously useful tablet functionality.

**tycho:** Well, why are you looking at net books *constantly*?

**chris:** reading stuff.
