Reading and Rereading
=====================

A long time ago, I thought I'd start meme, were people would list five
books that they'd read more than once. Sure the "list the five last
books you've read" meme travels around a fair bit, but this is sort of
an interesting turn. In most cases, you're not likely to have read a
book more than once unless you *really* liked it. But, sadly, I felt
that my contribution wasn't good enough, so I sat of the post forever.

Then as part of `my bah-humbag New Years
post <http://tychoish.com/posts/new-year/>`__ I mentioned starting a
"read.txt" file to track my reading accomplishments. I put in the
highlights of 2007, which read the world like the "The Best of Feminist
and Queer Science Fiction," but no matter, I will present for your
download, a copy of this file:

read.txt

It's in `Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`__
format, and I've decided to granularly list short stories, because
they're distinct, I need all the encouragement in the world to read more
of them, and I want to be able to keep track of which authors and what
not I read.

Below the fold, I present to you the "books you've read twice meme"
post. Do play along!

--------------

So we all read books, and we've all seen the "select books you've read
from this list" form of meme, and while I'm not claiming that this is
original, I think it'd be cool for people to post lists of books that
they've read more than once. Because that's an endorsement if there ever
was one.

To make it a meme, I think it would be great to post, links via comments
or trackbacks so that lea, so that we can all browse through these posts
to see what books people geek out on.

I'm also going to include a list of books I want to read a second time,
but haven't yet.

1. *Ender's Game* by Orson Scot Card
2. *Three-Fifths of Heaven* (a trilogy) by Melissa Scott
3. *The Foundation Trilogy* by Isaac Asimov
4. *Angles in America: The Millennium Approaches* by Tony Kushner

I seem to have a thing for trilogies. Books that I want to read again,
but haven't gotten to:

1. *Bastard out of Carolina* by Dorothy Alison
2. *Stranger in a Strange Land* by Robert Heinlein
3. *Babel-17* by Samuel R. Delany

Onward and Upward!
