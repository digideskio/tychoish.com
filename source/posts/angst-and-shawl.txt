So I was totally going to post this morning with a list of all the
things I had to do: math problems, look for articles on identity in
spoken communication, read an ethnography of a nursing home, write
emails to professors, beat up some incredibly awkwardly written windows
software, and of course writing and knitting. Sort of makes me nervous
just thinking about it.

Anyway, so I was going to post that list, and then I was going to say,
"sorry, I don't have anything more... inspiring at the moment, but I
have to run, and I don't know how much time I'm going to get with the
internet today..."

And while I still don't have very much to report to you all. The
knitting is going well, I'm glad to have a schedule, even a loose one
again, so with luck I'll be able to get some good writing done. I need
to figure out a good way to jump start things. But that's not why I'm
writing this post.

I got an email from someone I went to knit camp with pictures of Meg, my
shawl...

I'm a fan. Thanks Stephanie (sorry I don't have a link. Eek)!

Anyway, I'll see if something more inspiring comes up.

Cheers!
