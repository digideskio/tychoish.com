On Drupal and Product Design

Just because you can, doesn't mean you *should*. I `caught wind of this
twitter <http://twitter.com/davidfarre/statuses/887844697>`__ the other
day that encapsulated *perfectly* the kind of fear I have about getting
cornered (by someone else, or my intention) into making a "community
site" that seems to beg for drupal.

For the not-as-geeky among you, feel free to skip to the end where I
hope to extrapolate on the larger lessons about audience and technology
users.

Let's get into it, shall we:

`Drupal <http://drupal.org/>`__ is great software. There's a lot of
developer energy, there are a lot of tools, and by god this is a program
that can *do everything*. You want to host a community of bloggers?
Done. You want a discussion forum? Done. You want wikis and/or
collaborative tools that you can use to write structured documents?
Done. You want to tie into other popular services? Done. You want to
create custom content views and insulate certain kinds of content with
very granular access menus? Done.

And so forth. Oh, and by the way it's `free software/open source
software <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html>`__
to boot. Who can argue with that? Certainly not me. Though I wouldn't
consider myself a drupal master, and I don't use it on any of my sites,
I've played around with it a bit, and while I liked what I saw, there
were a couple of major problems for me.

1. The administrative interface was complicated and non-intuitive.

-  To be fair, I really don't like to interact with programs through
a web browser, and it seems to me that all I was doing with drupal
was clicking through page after page to try and find the one bit
that I needed to flip, but I'm hypersensative to these things. The
cause of this, as near as I could tell was the fact that the admin
interface and the front end of the site are differentiated by the
users access level *not* anything in the interface. This is
confusing and not, I think good form, visitors to the websites and
admins need different things.

2. Drupal sites reek of drupal.

-  Most web programing frameworks reek of themesleves, so this
doesn't set Drupal apart, but I think it's particularly bad in the
case of Drupal. What do I mean like reek? Well, it's that feeling
of "oh they're running drupal/rails/etc," here that you get 7
seconds after clicking on your first link (if not sooner). While
this isn't a bad thing, and I suspect most users don't notice this
very much, but I think if most independent site runners have sites
that seem to work the same, the reader will be left with the
impression that the sites are the same. We must think about total
experience.

3. The level of programing know-how needed for setup is non-trivial

-  While I think `Wordpress <http://wordpress.org/>`__, which I use a
lot and rather like, has gone too far in the other direction, [1]_
the fact that it's so much more complicated to get drupal from the
box to production, means that people who want to start a site
*now* need to break momentum to do programing (or hire someone.)
The truth is that I think the know how needed to really use
drupal, is like 10% less than the know how needed to build
something in `Django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`__. Maybe I'm
overplaying it, but not too much.

To be fair, I've not used the 6.x series of Drupal, but I think there's
a few broader lessons about creating a product/content and audience,
that comes from that nagging dread that drupal seems to create:

-  It's not clear that drupal knows weather it wants to be a web
framework or a CMS. *Know what you're trying to do, and be clear
about it.*
-  Different tools for different jobs, rather than one swiss-army knife.
*It's good to have related project that are integrated, of course but
that doesn't mean that you need to only have one program for
everything in your project.*\  [2]_
-  Create low barriers to entry. I didn't stay with drupal because after
a weeks of tinkering with it, I still didn't like what I was seeing,
so *First impressions count.*

`Upward <http://criticalfutures.com>`__!

there are templating features and capabilities that were around in
`b2/cafelog <http://cafelog.com/>`__ that have been abstracted and
removed, and while I understand the rationale, I still miss them.

I'm such a `unix <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy>`__
dweeb, so your milage may vary.
