I've been mentioning what I've been reading as part of my weekly
"accomplishment" posts, but I wanted to take the opportunity to write a
slightly longer review and reflection of some recent reading.

After delaying for far too long, I've finally gotten through the
April/May issue of Asimov's. There are probably all sorts of reasons why
double issues make a lot of sense for publishers, but I have to say that
I find them a bit grueling to read. Maybe it was just this particular
issue, but I found that the balance between novellas and short stories
wasn't terribly good, but maybe it was these stories, and my own tastes
rather than anything wrong with the editing itself. There were some
great stories: I loved `Kristen Kathryn
Rusch <http://kriswrites.com/>`__'s story, and I thought the cover story
was fun but weird in that way that I don't think Steampunk always works
as well as it seems like it should. Michael Swanwick's and Mike
Resnick's stories were high on the poignant-factor and low on the larger
meaning but they worked.

I've still not read the June or August issues, and I'm going to try and
start reading Clarkesworld. Here's hoping I still have time to do other
things after periodical reading obligations.

I also read (in about two weeks) *Excision* by Iain M. Banks. As I was
moving to the east coast I made the decision to start going through all
of the late 80s and 90s era space opera that I had totally missed, and I
can't quite recall why I chose Banks. I think there's something about
the grandiosity of The Culture that I really quite like. I found the
first two really hard to grok, and now they mostly make sense. I think
if I could do it again [1]_ I'd read *Use of Weapons*, maybe *Excision*,
I'd make *Player of Games* optional but definitely 3rd if anything and
then *Consider Phlebas*. I think *Phlebas* is among the best, but
without the context of the others its a bit too odd.

I've also been listening to podcasts: `The Outer Alliance
Podcast <http://blog.outteralliance.com>`__, `FLOSS
Weekly <http://twit.tv/floss>`__, `FaiF <http://faif.us>`__, and `Escape
Pod <http://escapepod.org>`__. Good content, great pacing for my now
daily walks, and it's good to stay in touch with all of that content.
Podcasts were something I'd listened to a lot when I was exercising or
driving alone. I've not driven very much in the last year, and my
exercise routine has only recently started to become regular. So it's
nice to get back in that habit.

What are you all reading? [2]_

   of books in the order of their publication.
