From the mail bag:

We've noticed that customers who have purchased or rated "Statistics
for the Behavioral Sciences" by Michael Thorne have also purchased
"Issid 07 Giessen: Abstracts of the 13th Biennial Meeting of the
International Society for the Study of Individual Differences,
Giessen, Germany, July 22-27, 2007" by Jugen Hennig. For this
reason, you might like to know that "Issid 07 Giessen: Abstracts of
the 13th Biennial Meeting of the International Society for the Study
of Individual Differences, Giessen, Germany, July 22-27, 2007" will
be released on September 30, 2007. You can pre-order yours by
following the link below.

I bet it's a page turner too!

Thanks amazon for that moment of joy in my life.
