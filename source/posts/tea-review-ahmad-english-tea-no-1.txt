Tea Review: Ahmad English Tea No. 1
===================================

I should preface this review by saying that I'm not a huge fan of Earl
Grey tea. The flavoring can be overpowering, and it's hard to get the
tea to brew strong enough, to compensate for the really powerful flavor.
At the same time, as a class of teas, I think bergamot-flavor works
better with tea than many others. Though I'm fond of vanilla flavored
black teas, I will admit that they don't always work well.

So, having said that. English Tea No. 1, is bergamot-flavored *but*, the
base is comparatively strong. So we end up with a rich, strong tea with
what is really just a hint of bergamot. The tea also takes milk better
than other Earl Grey-type teas, which I consider a plus.

This is a winner, without question.

It's also conveniently packaged (I was able to get foil wrapped bags) in
a form that brews a good, large cup. In point of fact most of the
remaining tea bags I have have found their way into my tea stash in my
book bag, and are my choice "road tea." Though I suspect that I've even
begun to horde them in my own way, which is high recommendation indeed.
