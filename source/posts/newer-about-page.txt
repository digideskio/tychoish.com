I just wanted to post something to point out that I've updated `my about
page <http://www.tychoish.com/about/>`__ and I think you might enjoy
having a look. I always do enjoy reading other peoples'. Also another
question:

How are you all feeling about the archives of this site? I've been slow
on the uptake with regards to updating tychoish.com's new archive
system. Which makes it sound as if I have something in the works, when
really all I did was grep through the archives and got lists of posts
that seemed relevant to a couple of key topics.

I'm not terribly keen on just throwing up an archive with links to
everything, becuase there are probably getting close to 1400 entries,
and I think not all of them are particularly relevant or interesting. So
I guess the question is: what do you find most useful in terms of
website archives, and what format works the best for you? What do you
want me to do?

Also, I think we're slowly creeping up on 600,000 words in the blog,
only a month or two more, I think.

Cheers, tycho
