I promise to post more than once today, with something that isn't just a
list, but I have a few thoughts that I think would be good to get out:

- I finished the sweater. Pictures to follow. On a scale of 1 to 10 I
rate this one a 7, because of the way the sleeves/shoulders fit, but
I suspect that I'll quite enjoy wearing it anyway.

- I'm at 2,000 words on the novel. It's hard to justify to yourself and
the world that you're writing a novel when you don't even have ten
manuscript pages, but I am I swear. I'm getting a hold of it slowly,
damnit! No more novella editing yet, but soon. Round two readers, get
ready!

- I need to figure out what I'm going to try and do with the novella
once I get it to a point that I'm comfortable marketing it. The
publication I was thinking of sending it out to has closed
submissions until March (they have a good "new writers" program,
potentially accept longer pieces and my parents knew the editor in
another life so my name will stand out--my real name has a way of
doing that. If not, I think the Marx quote will earn me points).
There's an indi-press that I'm interested in that looks like it's the
real deal, and I don't think that it will be too long for them. Other
markets don't have provisions for works between 25,000 and 40,000 in
their submission guidelines, so I'm at a loss.

- I read the entire `Ars Technica Leopard (OSX 10.5)
Review <http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/mac-os-x-10-5.ars/>`__
yesterday, and it was great. I have to say that he didn't talk about
the `RubyCocoa <http://rubycocoa.sourceforge.net/>`__ bridge thing
that `bsag talked
about <http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/2007/10/28/>`__ and the, I
think the term is, "scripting hooks" in AppleScript for python and
ruby, and the fact that `Ruby on
Rails <http://www.rubyonrails.org/>`__ and
`RubyGems <http://rubygems.org/>`__ ships with the new operating
system, which I think is totally awesome, and a really good move on
Apple's part. Having said all of this, I'm not in any rush, and
probably won't upgrade until after I finish the graduate school
application. What I have works now really well, and while I very much
want to get rid of all the brushed steel windows, I don't want to
have to worry about anything breaking or a massive backup for a
while.
