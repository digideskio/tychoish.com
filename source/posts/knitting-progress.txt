I'm 3-4 rows from the point where I add in the sleeves of the stranded
sweater I was knitting at knitting camp. I haven't really finished
sleeves, but I made 1 stranded sock, and the toe of two others.

I'm going to knit the sleeves down from a provisional cast on. This
could be interesting because, because the color pattern means that I'll
be half a stitch off for a row. Frankly I think if I choose the row
carefully, and do some creative increasing/decreasing I should be able
to make that blip pretty inconspicuous. Famous last words, right?

Sorry I don't post more about knitting. I think about posting more, I
swear.

Cheers!
