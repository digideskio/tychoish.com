I don't really have much to say tonight, though I've had crap running
through my head all day. We spent much of the day in the car driving
back from *points westward*. It was a good visit, of course, but as
always it's good to be back home again. I have *things to do tomorrow*,
which include chores, errands, and of course re-establishing the
routine. Which will involve work on this site. Of course. In the
interim. Here are some thoughts:

1. I'm knitting a boyfriend sock. This isn't a pattern, so much as an
intent. I'm obsessing about this rather than other projects that I
feel more loyal to right now. This also provoked some thought about
boyfriends in general, which I might write up at some point. Also,
I've realized that even though I'm, well, *pretty damn reflexive* on
tychoish.com, I'm also pretty walled off, about non-abstract queer
stuff. I'll have to write about that as well. I recognize that this
puts a lot of baggage into one woolen object, but then, I've realized
that I'm a strong believer in the idea that baggage should be
consolidated.

2. I bought yarn and fiber and things. I never procure new things in
this way. Including several (!) thousand yards of lace-weight. Oh
dear.

3. I'm reading/starting a story at the moment called "Who's afraid of
Wolf 359?" by Ken MacLeod. I'm so incredibly in love with this title.
This will be short story number 4. Of the previous three, I really
liked 2 and really wasn't feeling the third. That's pretty good
numbers, but it doesn't make me much of a short story person.

4. My new "turkish tile" sweater is about 14 inches long. 1.5 repeats
away from the underarm decision point. Which means, I'm really in
pretty good shape on this one.

5. The sleeve isolation has been stymied by a broken needle, though a
replacement will be procured tomorrow. I'm building up something of a
queue.

6. I now have two sweaters in progress and yarn for a third. Other than
these, I have plans for a few more. That's good news.

7. I think I'm pretty close to beginning to sketch out the revisions to
the final draft of the Mars novella. If you still have a copy that
you haven't read or given me feedback on, at least touch base with
me. And once I have some steam in the fiction department moving back
to the novel will be a blast.

8. If I owe you an email, and you haven't gotten it by the end of work
on Friday. Be concerned and email me again.

9. Sleep now! Bye!

Onward and Upward!
