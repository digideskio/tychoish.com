I must admit that I don't have a lot of news for you. I was reading
wikipedia last night, which is always dangerous. Means I don't have a
reading experience to talk with you about this morning. In lieu of this,
I'll point you to `smg's post about things she read in
2007 <http://smg.typepad.com/smg/2008/01/bibliophile.html>`__.

On the other hand I know a lot more about the retirement policies and
traditions of American jurists and (mostly commercial) aircraft than I
used to.

Also I did some knitting last night that didn't end in having to cut a
recalcitrant project from the needles. Success I say.

I have a knitting lesson to teach today, and then more very tycho-like
things to do. I guess.

Time for caf.

Onward and Upward!
