So I started a little throw away post here and it turned into a rather
ambitious series of TealArt posts that I'll post in the coming weeks.

I've sort of been neglecting TealArt for a number of weeks, using TA
posts as "warm up" for fiction and other writing projects, which means I
have something of a backlog (woo!) now that *Station Keeping* is wrapped
up for the present.

SK being wrapped up for the present, ironically means I need to spend
some time on that project, to get a few episodes taken care of, but I'm
trying to make sure I have enough time to dedicate to the novella
project. It's precarious, I tell you.

I'll be in touch as the weekend goes by, of course.

cheers!
