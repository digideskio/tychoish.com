All of the outlines for the novel length projects I start, have a space
at about the three-quarters point that says "overflow area to catch up
before the end". I always have a couple of scenes that float between
chapters, and having a place before the end where I can sort of take a
deep breath and get things lined up perfectly for the climax and end is
a good thing. Anyway, this isn't really a writing post, but the current
project has one of these areas, and I'm *so* going to need it. In part
because of chapters like the one I'm writing now. It's full of great
stuff, that needs to be in this book, and I love the way it feels to
write it. At the same time None of it was in the outline. All this by
way of saying that after a few weeks of not really "having any fiction
in me" I've returned with a vengeance to this novel, and I'm having a
lot of fun with it. Great stuff.
