Drupal Camp Chicago

Dear Readers,

I'm--or my alter-ego[^two name]--is going to be at `Drupal Camp
Chicago <http://www.drupalcampchicago.org/>`__ on the 24th and 25th of
October, baring an unforeseen catastrophe.

So this presents several possibilities:

1. You are already going to Drupal Camp Chicago and want to hang out
with me or talk me into presenting something with you. To this, I say
rock on.

2. You are or will happen to be in Chicago that weekend and don't give a
rats ass about drupal, I'm going to be (hopefully) meeting friends
from school on Saturday after the conference and I'd love to have
blog people there too.

--------------

In addition I'm thinking of proposing a session on `Open
MicroBlogging <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMicroBlogging>`__ and
`drupal <http://groups.drupal.org/node/14953>`__, which I think might be
really fun. If you're interested in contributing to this, I'd love
help/co-conspirators. And I'm just a guy who thinks this shit is cool.

I'm cross posting this but lets try and coordinate meet-ups and whatnot
in the comments thread of the tychoish.com post. You can always email or
jabber/xmpp me at garen@tychoish.com Rock On.

[^two name]: I so need to figure out how to have two buttons made/get
some sort of official "tycho garen" name tag. Ideas?
