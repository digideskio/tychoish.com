...and then tycho fell of the face of the earth.

Well not really, but you'd think it.

There isn't going to be a tealart piece this friday. These things
happen. Free time has gone to knitting (I'm now on the "interminable
neck hem" phase of the sweater), sleep (glorious sleep), and writing
other things.

I'm not foreclosing the possibility of weekend updates though.

Have a good friday.
