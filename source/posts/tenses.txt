Recent observations:

- I was listening to one of the Tor Podcasts, with `Patrick Nelson
  Hayden <http://www.nielsenhayden.com/>`__ and he said a couple of
  interesting things:

- Most science fiction magazines have readerships between 10 and 20k na
  month. The blog he runs with his wife and others, `Making Light
  <http://www.nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/>`__, which he described
  as a B-list blog, gets more than that.

- He described the BoingBoing ad revenue as being something like
  6-figures a month. Egad.

  This has gotten me thinking about my own traffic (which is no where
  near that good. No where. For the record.) This is particularly
  relevant as I'm thinking about the TealArt revision process. The
  questions that I've been milling over of late about what constitutes
  success, about audience development, and what constitutes quorum for
  "participatory culture" (ie, at what point is there enough momentum,
  for the force of the community to really be felt.)

- My left index finger needs a break. Hardcore. I could probably sew
  up the hem on this sweater, but I'm laying off the knitting. My
  wrist doesn't hurt that much, which means I can type. I think this
  is my body's way of telling me that I need to reevaluate priorities
  and energies.

- I'm still really fucking worried in general about my interview at
  the end of the week. And not the "oh my god, I have 8 hours of
  interview this friday," worry, more existential crap. Which makes me
  such an interesting blogger, I'm sure. I sure hope that there's
  sanity waiting for me at the end of this process.

- This illness which has been on the downswing since Thursday
  night/friday, is almost totally beat now. This is good.

- I spent some time last night perusing the John Barrowman videos on
  you tube. *sigh* I learned that he did a duet of "Night and Day"
  with Kevin Kline in the Cole Porter move, which I was finally able
  to it find on You Tube. Incredibly fun and homoerotic. This lead me
  down a rather deep rathole, but it was pretty enjoyable. While Night
  and Day is a fun song, most musicals are *so not my thing.* I fail
  as a queer guy in this regard. Not that this has proved to be a
  problem, but...

- I officially check livejournal way more often than the people on my
  friends page update.

Ok, that's all the news that's fit to sing.

Onward and Upward!
