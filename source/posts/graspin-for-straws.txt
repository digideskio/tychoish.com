At the time of writing, I've been going through a rough spot in my
(day-to-day) travels and have had some trouble focusing on writing
things. I suspect it will pass, but as I've been going through my todo
list and my brain for things to write about, in the mean time I've noted
something of a pattern in the way that I lead in my blog posts.

Even though I read something a few years ago that said, basically, the
way to be successful at blogging is to write your posts like newspaper
articles: strong lead, details to follow, everything but elaboration in
the first paragraph. The thought is that this style of writing is the
most effective way to reach people and hook them into what you're
saying. Expecting reader efficiency. It's a good idea.

I'm remarkably bad at this. I blog like I talk, I fear, and so my posts
are often bottom heavy and meander around to the point. I know my flaws.

In any case, I think I've uncovered a (small) list tropes for the way
that I begin posts:

-  I mention that something has been on my todo list and then write
about something that's tangentially related.

-  I tell some sort of semi-funny, self deprecating introductory story,
and get to the point at the beginning of the second paragraph.

-  I talk about previous posts that serve as background to the post that
I'm writing now. May or may not include links.

-  Some sort of abrupt but not all together straight forward beginning,
eg. "So I was thinking that..."

Did I miss any?
