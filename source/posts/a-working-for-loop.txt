==================
a working for loop

So I was sorting through my `org-mode <http://www.orgmode.org/>`__ files
and I found a little snippet of code that I had lying around. I've had a
problem with shell scripting for a while. I *use* bash a lot, and I've
written a few functions, and procedural scripts that I've found useful
in my travels, but anything that requires "logic," often escapes me in
tragic and epic ways.

Here's the problem. I had a directory of notes that I had compiled for
presentation in an `ikiwiki <http://www.ikiwiki.info>`__ blog for notes.
As I wanted these notes to be in my org-mode system, I needed to take a
directory of 60 or so files, and turn them into a single org file. As an
additional bonus, I needed the files to be organized by date rather than
by the alphabet. Also, as ikiwiki generated page titles from the
filename, I needed to capture that information in the org-mode file.
Here's what I came up with

::

   for i in `ls -t`;  do
      echo -e "$i" >> ~/org/legacy_notes.org &&
      cat "$i" >> ~/org/legacy_notes.org ;
   done

It works as a one liner, but it works. I think previous attempts have
left out crucial semi-colons or the ``do`` and ``done`` statements. No
clue. Baby steps folks.
