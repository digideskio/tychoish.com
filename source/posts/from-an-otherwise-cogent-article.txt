The scary part is this actually made sense to me on the first reading,
it's funny mostly because it is an incredibly out of place piece of
prose. The article until this point is very conversationally written.
Also, frankly the "awkward" invocation of Nietzsche is priceless.

Rather the gendered subject emerges through a regulatory scheme of
gender--we are literally brought into being as gendered subjects
through gender regulation. From this perspective, the very idea of a
regulatory "apparatus" appears as a kind of structuralist
Althusserian hangover clouding the Foucaltian insight into the
radical reach of subject production through regulatory discourse. In
Foucault's understanding of the power that circulates through the
subject of regulation, there can be no actual apparatus because
there is no sharp distinction between what is produced and what is
regulating--we are not simply targets but vehicles of power? Thus to
paraphrase Nietzsche awkwardly, we must be able to conceive
regulation without the regulator, to understand regulation as only
and always materializing in its effects, and to understand these
effects as specific to that which is being regulated.
