*How long did you think I could go without a blog post about the state
of the blog. Who do you think I am?*

Just as an aside I'm enjoying my job, but there's a lot of work. On the
upside I'm generally feeling pretty productive in my working and non
working life, and I get to listen to podcasts, so I've been learning
lots, on top getting things done in work and outside of work.

I think I must work better when my time is crunched. I wish it were
slightly less crunched, but that's the way life is. Once I get a little
more caught up and settled in, I should be able to squeeze a little bit
more out of my self. Here's hoping.

Thanks for reading. I hope to have a little content for you today.
Particular thanks to `Sheri <http://www.sfharper.com>`__ for commenting,
it's great to get such good comments from such great folk.
