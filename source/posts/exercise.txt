No secret, I've been stressed. Readers of the blog who are friends with
my parents (Hi Angie!) have even told them "wow, [tycho] looks
stressed." One of the things I've been doing for a few weeks now, in
part to manage this is to begin some sort of exercise regimen. There's a
park not far from where I live, and I've taken to going out for an hour
in the late afternoon, when my brain is *tired* and I can't really write
anyway.

Amazingly, it's been a great thing. Exercise helps the mood, I had
enough psychology to know that to be true, and one thing that I've
lamented, since I stopped commuting, is that I haven't really listened
to podcasts in any concerted way. I'm incredibly behind as a result, and
the walks, including doing good things for my mood and stamina, have
been a good excuse to spend some item consuming media that I find very
refreshing and informing.

Exercise is a tough things, I'm a skinny, reasonably active guy, but I
tend towards short bursts, rather than concerted activity. Which is
fine, but dance weekends are *really tough* on me, as I wear out too
quickly. One really needs to be in shape in order to dance well, but
I've found that it's hard to *get* in shape only by dancing. So making a
point of going out is a good thing indeed, and I feel better. So there.
