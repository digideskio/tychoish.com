Email is Still Broken, but at Least People are Talking

Email is broken. I don't think the assertion really even requires an
example for everyone to concur. Spam, ongoing wars over decades old
standards and protocols, bacon (automatically generated email that you
want), listservs, poorly written clients, and mixed expectations
regarding replays, make email frustrating to deal with under the best of
situations.

Email is also inescapable. There's no other technology around at the
moment which pushes messages out to users as effectively (every other
thing is pull), provides administrators with as many tools and options,
or has such ubiquitous adoption rates. I'd love to be able to say "don't
send me emails, I won't get it," but the truth is that I get and send a
bunch of email, and every other option for "next wave" digital
communication fails to impress.

Including `Google Wave <https://wave.google.com/wave/>`__.

Don't get me wrong, Wave is nifty. Hampered mostly by an interface which
is foolish and gimmicky, I think Wave provides capabilities that we need
on the Internet. Wave makes multi-user chat useful for people who have
trouble wrapping their brain around IRC. Wave strikes the right balance
between "real-time" and persistence (which is mighty difficult), and
most importantly...

Wave gets people thinking about email, and what the ideal replacement
might look like. And that's a good thing indeed.

Maybe, more importantly, Wave moves many of the trivial uses of email,
into a more suitable format (XMPP) so that email, or whatever replaces
it, has a more easily defined task. Maybe there are a couple of XMPP
applications: Jabber, Wave, and (----) [1]_ that work in concert to
alleviate the pressure on email and make it much more clear what "the
email killer" will look like.

To my mind, one of the biggest problems with email is that we use it for
too much, including a number of things that it's not ideally suited for.
Perhaps the way to fix email is to fix all of these other communication
problem, and see what's left.

Here's a list of the things what I think we use email for today, to
which it is unsuited, followed by a couple of examples?

-  **Notifications.** There's been a reply to a comment on your blog,
someone has commented on your face-book status update, it's time to
renew your domain name, your payment has been processed. Etc.

-  **File Transfer.** Look at my resume. Here's the paper I owe you. I
was looking for your article and wondered if you might have a copy
you could share? Here's this funny picture my uncle sent me. Etc.

-  **Content Review.** Could you take a look at this essay or bug
report? I mentioned this in an IM but didn't want to send it in that
format.

This leaves us with a relatively short list of things: genuine letters
(i.e. first class mail; generally "asynchronous personal communication")
and listservs (which like Usenet are probably the best way to have
async-group communication online from the users perspective). And spam,
but we don't care about that.

So what's the best way to handle what's left? Hell, what's the best way
to handle the rest of it?

I don't think there are good answers yet, at all, and I look forward to
continuing to thing about these issues in a *big* way.

I think this might tie back to my `posts
on <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/notifications-and-computing-contexts>`__
`notification
systems <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/how-id-like-to-be-notified>`__,
but more along the lines of what we currently use SMS for (say,) but
I'm not sure what this looks like in a personal (much less
interpersonal) method. Lots and lots of whitelisting, that's for
sure.
