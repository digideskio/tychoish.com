Science Fiction Memes
=====================

Wait, before you ignore this post, know that this isn't a discussion of
*internet* science fiction memes, but rather replicating trends in the
genre. I'm not going to post a list of books or movies with an
embarrassingly small number of titles bolded or italicized. Just saying.

In any case, I've been milling about the memes in science fiction, the
trends that repeat (with varying degrees of utility) for a number of
weeks, and it remains a chief nagging point on my todo list. As I return
to science fiction writing it's something that I've found myself eager
to consider as I make sense of the genre (again).

This was, like a number of the essays/posts about writing methods and
practices that I've posted in recent weeks, spurred by listening to one
of `Cory Doctorow's <http://craphound.com/>`__ podcasts of a panel he
was on with a few other science fiction writers.

There were a lot of somewhat germane debates that are so typical of
science fiction discussions, over literary-ness, over "accuracy" and the
ability of science fiction to predict the future [1]_, and originaity in
the genre and so forth (actually I need to write a post about this). But
one thing that Cory said that struck me, about both, I think literary
tendencies and originality was that science fiction is a genre where
almost cut their teeth on a retelling of Isaac Asimov's "Nightfall,"
story. To drive this home, in the next week or so I listed to `Nancy
Kress' "Ej-Es" <http://escapepod.org/2007/07/26/ep116-ej-es/>`__ on
Escape pod. Which was amazing, and then I realized that of course it
followed the basic "Nightfall" type story structure. (Sorry for the
semi-spoiler, it's still a great story.) Nightfall is not only a great
story, but its framework gives us the possibility of thinking about our
reflexes, and habits, that can be a great tool for getting into
"sociological sf."

After recognizing the nightfall meme, I thought immediately about
another huge trope in (particularly hard) SF: the Mars book. In addition
to retelling nightfall, there's also a meme of writing "the mars book"
about the red planet. Think: `Martian
Chronicles <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_Chronicles>`__, and
`Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars
Trillogy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy>`__, and not to
forget `Stranger in a Strange
Land <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land>`__ and so
on and so forth. Hell, my current novella project is a Mars Book, though
it's by no means a hard-sf project. The Mars book/story, I think *is*
the hard SF trope, because it lets writers talk about space travel,
colonization, and so forth, without getting "fantastic."

There's also sub/alter-genres, like space operas, and alternate history,
and the various -punks (cyberpunk, steampunk, Cory's disneypunk, etc)
and so forth, that are in their own way memes. There are conventions
which are played with and broken/bent to varying degree's, but still
replicate throughout significant swaths of the literature, and if
nothing else I think that's incredibly interesting.

I guess the main point of this argument is to say that, I'm not sure
that Memes are such a bad thing. In a lot of ways they seem to be a lot
of the connective force behind the genre. I mean it can be taken to
extremes, of course, but all things can. Also, I think it would be
foolish to suggest that SF is the only genre that has such memes. I
guess this all got started by a question about "is there anything that's
truly new and original happening now," and the answer is, yes and no.

Everything new, even recombinations of old material is, original. Even,
dare I say, Kirk/Spock Star Trek fan fiction represents some kind of
forward movement for the genre and the community. Now don't take the
Kirk/Spock too far, and there is such a thing as blatant plagiarism, but
I think at the heart of the matter is the fact that we don't actually
*really* want things that are original and different, that kind of thing
is jaring, and by its very nature difficult to understand. This doesn't
mean that a given retelling of Nightfall, or a book about Mars, doesn't
further a discussion along. Even in science, where new studies are
supposed to create new knowledge, it's all incremental.

The qualities that make good science fiction, captivating stories,
interesting questions and perspectives, honest characters, and enjoyable
settings are for the most part independent of there being "something
new," and I think you can say something really new in a fairly typical
space opera, and tell a completely contrite in *the new thing that we've
never seen yet*.

So there.

Have fun, tycho

Cory rehashes some of these ideas
`here <http://www.locusmag.com/Features/2007/07/cory-doctorow-progressive-apocalypse.html>`__,
but I think on the whole, science fiction isn't really about the
future, and never has been. "True" to current understandings of
science, or not, science fiction is always both future oriented
(looking forward) and about the present. If you're a contemporary
setting using contemporary technology, or in a near future setting,
using "accurate" technology, or if you're writing a story ten
thousand years in the future using wildly futuristic technology, it's
all to a certain measure irrelevant, and even more importantly, it's
all made up anyway.
