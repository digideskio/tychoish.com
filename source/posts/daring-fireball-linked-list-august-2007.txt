`Daring Fireball Linked List: August
2007 <http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/august#tue-28-mwd>`__:

There's plenty about markup and CSS, but the heart of the book
consists of general design strategies for mobile platforms, and why
you should care in the first place about the experience mobile users
get when visiting your site.

(from `Daring Fireball <http://www.daringfireball.net>`__.)

The answer to the question of mobile web design, is of course RSS, and
other XML like systems, IMHO.

Hell, I think
`gopher <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_%28protocol%29>`__, is
actually probably pretty close to the mark, and frankly I'm ok with that
