While this week flew by in many respects and I only got a couple of
posts out, there is much change and progress afoot. This post is an
attempt to catalog some of the work I (and others) have been doing that
*hasn't* made it onto the blog:

- Discussion of the ":doc:`Better Task List </posts/better-task-lists>`" post by jfm`. Including
  spoilers for posts that I hope to have ready next week.

- Further discussion of the
  :doc:`make emacs better </posts/make-emacs-better>` post. I'm thinking
  that it's probably nearly time to split that into a few pages.
  There's a lot of great content there and people have added a lot. I'm
  a huge fan.

- Not a link, except to say that I did some fairly substantial tweaks
  of the site's design, which is probably only worth mentioning because
  I suspect most people read the site on RSS. Different fonts in the
  headers, and I rearranged the masthead to be a little more clean, and
  changed the links a bit.

- I'm in the slow process of cleaning up the `Cyborg
  Institute <http://cyborginstitute.com>`__ site which I've neglected
  for far too long. I'm importing a lot of the content that I wrote
  over there, notably sygn and tubmle-manager. Next up, some
  straggling blog posts, and a clean up of the existing content to
  match my current projects and work.

- The :doc:`/knitting` page or blog, which is collected separately from
  rhizome posts is in full swing, and I hope to be able to post a
  few things there every now and then.

- There's now a real tag index and a tag cloud that looks like
  something. I'd avoided putting together a page like this for some
  time, because there were a lot of junk tags and enough really big
  tags that the cloud didn't really work. I've mostly cleaned that up,
  leaving the wiki with a rather awesome tag cloud

  I've also found a few things on the web that I think you might enjoy on
  the web:

- A new blog called
  `observatory <http://observatory1.wordpress.com/>`__. I've been
  talking to the author a bit. I realized that there aren't very many
  blogs that are so verbose. I suppose
  `ByteBaker <http://bytebaker.com/>`__ is another example, but there
  aren't many of them around.

- `undo-tree-mode <http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UndoTree>`__ is a
  nifty little emacs hack that makes undoing and redoing much less
  complicated and weird. (From that make emacs better discussion.) Though I have to
  admit that I no longer have a problem with the default behavior, even
  if I know it's a bit counter intuitive.

- I've been reading `Strange Horizons <http://strangehorizons.com/>`__
  more than I have in the past, thanks mostly to
  `instapaer <http://www.instapaper.com/>`__ and InstaFetch for
  Android. I was particularly found of Genevieve Valentine's
  column/review of a `glorious mess of a movie
  trope <http://www.strangehorizons.com/2011/20110704/valentine-c.shtml>`__.

That's all I have for this week.

Comments Undo-tree also allows for undoing based on time (see
`here <http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com/2010/11/undo.html>`__),
apparently a feature that vim has.
