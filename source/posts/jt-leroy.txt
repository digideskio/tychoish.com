JT Leroy's Blog

Wow. Some background. JT Leory's story is very similar to another you
may be familair with: that of Anthony Godby Johnson. The Wikipedia
articles above should give you the background. Basically LeRoy/Johnson
were/are potentially fictitious authors who 'live' very secluded lives,
and tell stories about their tortured childhoods. This is in effect the
modern literary hoax, and I couldn't be more interested.

I think JT LeRoy is much less cut and dry than AGJ, in AGJ's case, there
were certain legal and medical records which didn't exist, which should
have been part of the public record, possibly of course, and the
complete dirth of cases, lead to a fairly logical situation. JT, on the
other hand. *shrug*

I'm fascinated by this, and aperantly, my source(s) tell me there's an
upsurge in chatter about LeRoy. I think the connotations of identity
here are huge. I keep saying that 'how others see you' is potentially as
much about "who you are" as, how you see yourself; and this sure throws
a wrench in it.

Thoughts? Questions? I recognize this is a pretty week post, and relies
heavily on the wikipedia accounts (which are by my reading dead on; the
LeRoy one, leans a bit in LeRoy's direction, but no matter.)

I had heretofore been completely oblivious to it's existence, and while
I don't actually want to read the blog, its existence is most
interesting...
