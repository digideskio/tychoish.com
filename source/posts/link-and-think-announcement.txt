Link and Think Announcement

Last year when Brad opened up Link and Think for the 2002 Worlds AIDS
day, I eagerly signed up. And then TealArt promptly crashed and was down
until January. So we missed it, which was seriously not cool.

We're at least going to try and make amends this year. For all of you
who also operate weblogs/independent websites. I'd like to implore you
all to take part. It's a great idea and a good way to unify and take
part in a worthy crowd. Check it out, join up, and we'll be here on the
first for World AIDS day Link and Think.
