`Empirical
Questions <http://www.roughtheory.org/content/empirical-questions/#comments>`__:

A book of philosophy should be in part a very particular species of
detective novel, in part a kind of science fiction. By detective
novel we mean that concepts, with their zones of presence, should
intervene to resolve local situations. They themselves change along
with the problems. They have spheres of influence where, as we shall
see, they operate in relation to ‘dramas’ and by means of ‘cruelty’.
They must have a coherence among themselves, but that coherence must
not come from themselves. They must receive their coherence from
elsewhere.

(from `Roughtheory.org <http://www.roughtheory.org>`__.)

This is a passage, from Deleuze's *Difference and Repetition*, and I
think part of why I like him so much. Maybe I'm focusing too much on
Anti-Oedipus, when really DR is where it's at. Hrmm.

Cheers!
