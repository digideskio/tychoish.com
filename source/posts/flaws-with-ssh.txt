In response to [[9 Awesome SSH Tricks\|9-awesome-ssh-tricks]] some
posted the following quote (on the old commenting system):

The workarounds have become smoother and some of the things we can
do with networks of Unix machines are pretty impressive, but when
ssh is the foundation of your security architecture, you know things
aren't working as they should.

So let's clarify things a bit. SSH is *great* as an end user protocol,
and great for dealing with the realities of our distributed computing
environment in an exigent manner, SSH lets us:

-  connect securely to remote systems.

-  quickly establish tunnels through remote machines.

-  admister remote systems securely.

-  provide end-users with key-based authentication.

SSH is *great* for providing end users with a secure way of interacting
with computer systems in networked environment. It's not, however, the
magic bullet for security policy. If you or your organizations security
practices revolve entirely around SSH tunnels, then you're probably in
trouble or about to be in trouble. Use traditional VPNs and TLS/SSL when
it makes sense and develop a sane security policy.

But don't forget SSH and if you do use SSH, know that there are some
really [[awesome\|essay/9-awesome-ssh-tricks]] things that OpenSSH makes
possible.
