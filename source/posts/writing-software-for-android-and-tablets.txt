This post is mostly just an overview of
`Epistle <http://kooklab.com/epistle.html>`__ by `Matteo
Villa <http://twitter.com/_swanz>`__, which is--to my mind--the best
Android note taking application ever. By the time you read this I will
have an Android Tablet, but it's still in transit while you read this
and that's a topic that dissevers it's own post.

Epistle is a simple notes application with two features that sealed the
deal:

1. It knows `markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown>`__,
and by default provides a compiled rich text view of notes before
providing a simple notes editing interface. While syntax highlighting
would be nice, we'll take what we can get.

2. It's a nice, simple application. There's nothing clever or fancy
going on. This simplicity means that the interface is clean and it
just edits text.

For those on the `other side <http://apple.com/ios/>`__ there's
`Paragraft <http://itunes.apple.com/app/paragraft/id412998778?mt=8>`__
that seems similar. While in my heart of hearts I'm probably still
holding out for the tablet equivalent [1]_ of emacs. In the mean time, I
think developing a text editing application that provide a number of
paradigmatic text editing features and advances for the touch screen
would be an incredibly welcome development.

In the end there's much work to be done, and the tools are good enough
to get started.

I want to be clear to say equivalent and not replacement, because
while I'd like to be able to use emacs and have that kind of
slipstream writing experience on an embeded device, what I really
want is something that is flexible and can be customized and lets me
do all the work that I need to do, without hopping between programs,
without breaking focus, that makes inputting and manipulating text a
joy. And an application that we can trust (i.e. open source, by a
reputable developer,) in a format we can trust (i.e. plain text.)
Doesn't need to be emacs and doesn't need lisp, but I wouldn't
complain about the lisp.
