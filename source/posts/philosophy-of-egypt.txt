Philosophy of the Present, Egypt
================================


I've been watching the Egyptian revolution, off and on since it started.
There's so much interesting stuff going on: the pragmatics of political
organization, the foundations of revolutionary movement, the evolving
state of American political power, and the way that Egyptians are
racialized particularly in contrast to Iranians and Tunisians.

The aspect that I'm most interested is in what western analysis of
"Janurary 25th" tells us about how the west has made sense of past
revolutionary moments in the last '50 years notably the Iranian
revolution and "May'68."

Largely I fear that it is way too soon to really say anything terribly
useful on the subject. That hasn't stopped people, of course.

I'm not sure what to make of either `Ken
MacLeod's <http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/2011/02/br-battle-of-tahrir-square-means-we-can.html>`__
or `Slavoj
Žižek's <http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2011/feb/10/egypt-miracle-tahrir-square?CMP=twt_guj>`__
articles on the subject. There are aspects of this kind of theorizing
that I really like and that really appeals to me. At the same time,
optimism seems foolhardy.

There's work still to be done: both theoretical and revolutionary. But
isn't there always?
