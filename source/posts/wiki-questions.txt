Wiki Questions

Though I've never asked directly about this, I have sort of hinted
around the edges and thought about it a bit, so I figure, it's worth
bringing up. Here's the question:

**You install a new wiki somewhere, and you have a blank "welcome to
your wiki page." How do you go about editing these pages and developing
a wiki from there?**

The idea behind a wiki is that it provides a quick way to edit and
create web pages, without needing to know very much about HTML and
associated technologies. Right?

In addition to radically de-centering authorship, wikis also have
profound effects on the structure and organization of
websites/documents. While much attention has been paid to the former on
a social and software level, [1]_ I think the latter has been mostly
ignored.

I think the tendency is to think of the organization of data within a
wiki as being largely emergent phenomena. I think this is more true when
there are a lot of people starting a wiki and when the size/growth of
the wiki is appropriate for the community size.

The truth is that I think this kind of approach ignores this huge data
management problem because it's not an issue for 10% of
wikis/documents/collections. I mean, if you throw up a wiki you can't
just *let it go* the way that `Ward
Cunningham <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham>`__ did for the
first wiki (because the people who would contribute and the internet
would come to the wiki from a much different place), and sites like
wikipedia have a lot of very intentional structure. And while I like the
idea of emergent structure, I'm not sure that it actually works in
practice. [2]_

And I'm not sure the question of\ *what* is in the wiki matters a lot
for the organization, because I'm more interested in how much and what
kind of structure people create when they're editing in this kind of
document, rather than specifics about naming schemes or the rationale
behind a classification system. I guess, if I had to break this question
down further I'd be interested in:

-  What kind of metadata (categories, tags) do you use?
-  How hierarchical is your document. Too much hierarchy and pages get
lost at the end of trees, not enough and you have a mess of files and
no way to tell them apart.
-  Do you use natural phrase WikiWord titles for pages, or do you have a
less natural naming scheme?
-  How much do you use talk/discussion/commentary pages?
-  CamelCase Wiki words or not?
-  What kind of search tools do you use? Does this help?

Your thoughts are much appreciated.
