It's been a while since I've written a status update, but I think I've
been up to a few things which haven't managed to work their way onto the
site, so I think I'll collect them all here, in a sort of "state of the
tycho" report.

- I've gotten more into the **shape note singing.** I went to the New
York State Sacred Harp Convention in Cambridge New York and had a
blast. I've `written here </2009/10/shaped-notes>`__ before about
this, and I don't know how much I can really add to that. I'm
continuing to be impressed by all of the young people who are into
Shape Note. A fair number younger than me (though not by much). It's
strange to have acquired *another* hobby that takes even more time
that I don't really feel like I have; however, it's a blast, and I
feel like it's a good thing in my life.

- I've made a number of `post collections" for the tychoish
site <http://tychoish.com/archive/)>`__, which provide an overview of
posts on a number of subjects that aren't generated by some sort of
tagging system, nor are they comprehensive. Rather, they represent a
hand picked collection of topics that I've covered in some depth and
the posts that best exemplify these subject areas. I expect this list
to grow and shift slightly, but for the moment we have:

- `Cooperative Economics </archive/cooperatives/>`__

- `Lists </archive/lists/>`__

- `New Media and Blogging </archive/new-media/>`__

- `Technology Futurism </archive/technology/>`__

I hope you find these archives useful. If you have a suggestion for
another topic or theme, or additional posts that you think might work
well in one of these posts, do feel free to touch base with me about
this.

- **The job.** I've not written here a great deal about my job or my
move in late June across the country. I figure I write a lot about
work things most of the day anyway. Having said that, I know at least
a couple c-workers (Hi M.G. & S.S.) and other work-related folks read
this, so it's no great secret. Some brief reflection:

It's going well. My team, such as it is, has sort of found a rhythm that
works for us, our project progresses, and even though it always feels
like I've written to the end of the subject matter at hand, there's
always seems to be something captivating "up next to write about.

And I get to work with and write about free software stuff with a bunch
of geeks. I'm learn stuff about writing all the time somehow, and while
I think I probably work a bit too much (or so the cats seem to think)
it's going well.

- The **Cyborg Institute** is a project that I need to figure out how
to do better. I think having it as a "blog" was the wrong thing to
do, an I'm glad I've stopped doing that. I started it when I was in a
much different place in so many of my projects. It was long before I
started the job, I was writing about different things on the tychoish
blog, and a million things. Now, things are different, and I need to
figure out a better way of doing things. Having said that, things
haven't been *completely* dead... News forthcoming.

- We're approaching the beginning of November, when I said in a
`previous post </2009/10/writing-in-the-moment>`__ that I wanted to
finish the **novel** I was working on by then. Well that didn't
happen. Not only did it not happen, but I didn't even manage to
finish the blasted scene that I've been working on for a while.
Having said that, I have made progress (on that scene), and I have a
passable plan for finishing the last of the novel. So that's a good
thing.

- I gave up the ghost on my somewhat aged "frankenbuntu" (eg. a quirky
variant of Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty) installation on my laptop, and
installed **Arch Linux** on the laptop. I've been remarkably pleased
with this. There are quirks, but *lord were there quirks* on the old
installation. I'm happy with the outcome, and I've basically switched
to using this machine as my primary computer.
