Today was the first day that my `regular blog
post/essay <http://tychoish.com/posts/awesome-window-manager/>`__
*didn't* get crossposted to `my
livejournal <http://tychoish.livejournal.com/>`__. This is one of the
cool things that I can do now that I've redone tychoish.com. So LJ-land
if you want to read about a really cool linux/open source thing click
the above link.

In other news, I've been toying around with
`identi.ca <http://www.identi.ca>`__ which is the flagship of an open
source federated twitter clone called `laconica <http://laconi.ca/>`__.
(You can join/follow my "dents" `here <http://www.ident.ca/tychoish>`__
if you use any Laconica site.)

Now I'm a really big fan of `the
twitter <http://www.twitter.com/tychoish/>`__ except that my prefered
method of interacting with twitter is via the IM/jabber interface, which
hasn't worked for months. While I'd *love* to jump ships to another
platform (like identi.ca or jaiku), twitter has too many people that
wouldn't jump ship with me. So until Laconica can import tweets a little
better, I'm going to be in a couple of different worlds for a while.
Anyway...

I `listened to an interview <http://twit.tv/floss37>`__ with the author
the other day, and I think I'll be writing some blog posts on this
subject very soon, but its mightily cool, conceptually (because it gives
everyone a lot of control over their microblogging life.)

A while back I wrote a post--after identi.ca started up, actually--about
how `microblogging needed to be thought of as an evolution of IRC and
IM <http://tychoish.com/posts/doing-irc-right/>`__ rather than an
evolution of blogging. Not so much in terms of database structure
(though I hear that would help,) but in terms of user interface and
interaction.

I still think this is the case. Just FYI. And I still want to use
something that really works. And better access control would be good.

Ok, blathering over.

Onward and Upward!
