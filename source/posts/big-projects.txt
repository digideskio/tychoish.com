Big Projects

I really like big projects, you know a big project that takes a long
time to finish, like say a long knitted jacket on needles with a 2.5
millimeter diameter, or a novel. I think it's a personality thing. I
also really like the thrill of finishing big projects; I also really
like the fact that projects like these can get done. It is possible to
finish a sweater. It is possible to write a novel. There are a lot of
things that we dedicate time to (often "work" things) that are never
ending, and I think this is why the big-project thing is a useful
adaptation: it makes it possible to obsess over a project, for a while,
but then, eventually it's done.

I think this is part of the reason why I need to go to graduate school:
it fits my temperament. It would, however, be impossible to communicate
this with the admissions committee, but perhaps in person, I'll be able
to communicate it without coming off as creepy

In any case, while I've been pretty productive this week, what with the
big paper and the grad school application, all my other projects got
moved to the back burner. So I find myself without a big primary project
underway. Here's what I'm (thinking about) juggling.

-  the redesign of the TealArt website
-  Breakout, the novel project I'm working on
-  design of the next sweater project
-  more graduate school stuff
-  station keeping, season 2
-  revise the Mars novella and think about publication (contingent).

I figure I have 3 weeks before I need to have a new sweater design ready
to go. Season 2 of station keeping depends on having the new TealArt
website ready to go. The new TealArt is something that requires a ton of
work, I think, but is something I desperately need to do in order to be
able to host the knit along-s that I want to be able to host. And of
course I want to write, and I haven't been able to do that for me in a
while, so that's up there. The novella edits are contingent upon getting
feedback from readers. I have a really entertaining offer concerning the
book publication, but again, contingent upon feedback.

So that's what I'm up to. Hows you?

Onward and Upward!
