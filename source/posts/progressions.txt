I've been somewhat remiss in posting here. Nevertheless, I've managed to
get rather a lot of things done in the couple of weeks that I think
merits an update post.

I've posted two new things to `Critical
Futures <http://criticalfutures.com/>`__, my final post--for now--about
:doc:`:/technical-writing/dexy`, called `make all
dexy <http://criticalfutures.com/2011/02/make-all-dexy>`__. and a post
about `new media <http://criticalfutures.com/archive/new-media>`__ on
`What we Learn from
WikiLeaks <http://criticalfutures.com/2011/02/what-we-learn-from-wikileaks>`__.

I've also updated the `Critical Futures
Archive <http://criticalfutures.com/archive/>`__, particularly the
`technical
writing <http://criticalfutures.com/archive/technical-writing/>`__
series and the `new
media <http://criticalfutures.com/archive/new-media>`__ series. I think
hand crafted archives are incredibly valuable, but they're hard to
maintain, which I suppose is the point, and I've been a poor steward
over the past few years. At the moment, the full archives of Critical
Futures (nee tychoish.com, nee tealart.com) are listed on the archive
page. The content has never gone anywhere, nor do I think the old
content is any better than I used to, but it's good to not have it
totally hidden. I'm also trying to keep the hand crafted archives more
up to date. It's a struggle.

I've also been doing some wiki work around these parts, mostly in the
:doc:`technical writing </technical-writing>` section, including new pages
about :doc:`:/technical-writing/atomicity`, :doc:`/technical-writing/automation`,
:doc:`/technical-writing/compilation`, :doc:`/technical-writing/dexy`, and
:doc:`/technical-writing/filters`. I'm also working on ways of marrying this
wiki with `Critical Futures <http://criticalfutures.com/>`__, by way of
the critical futures section. It's in progress, of course but
there's a blurb at the bottom of all CF posts that says:

Disqus comments are provided to support legacy comments on old
posts, and as a last resort in cases where other means of
communication are ineffective. Otherwise please consider leaving a
comment.

The link doesn't work as well as I want to, and maybe I need to set up a
specific comments page adding widget, as on the submissions page.
Couldn't hurt. Also on my list of things to do: make a more fitting
index page that draws attention to all sorts of content on the wiki, not
just rhizome. That's on the list.

Also on the list:

- Writing fiction like crazy: I'm working on the penultimate chapter of
  the novel.

- Something with the `Cyborg
  Institute <http://cyborginstitute.com/>`__. It needs to happen.

- More regular blogging here. It's on the list!
