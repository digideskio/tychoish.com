Linux UI Tweaking

I've written here a little about the problems I have with the options
for `user interfaces in
linux <http://tychoish.com/posts/production-ready/>`__, and while *for
me* Awesome goes a long way toward s fixing these issues,
particularly/even on smaller screens, but I continue to think that
paying more attention to user interface issues will be a very good thing
for the platform. This new laptop is the second linux install I've done
recently (third if you count the VM on my mac, and fourth if you count
the multiple attempts it took me to get my desktop to working order) and
the expereince has--I hoped granted me some useful perspective on some
UI concerns. And since this is my blog... I bet you can see where this
is going.

While I think as far as non-tiling window managers go, OS X/quartz/aqua
still is the leader of the pack, I'm not longer as appaled by everything
that is GNOME, but it took me a while to realize this (which is a huge
barrier for new users, and a big problem, but not a problem I'm quite
equipt to suggest.) If you're new to gnome, and geeling a little offput
by it's "clunkyness," here are some suggestions to make things a little
less painful (espically if you're the Awesome type).

- Tweak and change the system fonts. As near as I can tell sub-pixel
  rendering is turnned off in GNOME by default (it's on in KDE), which
  is what makes fonts look smooth and pretty. Turning this on, and
  making the fonts smaller, made a world of difference for me. Adding
  in good fonts for screen reading (like the forbidden MS Verdana font,
  and the Google Andriod Fonts) really added something to the
  experience. I think it's easy to forget how much a really good,
  really readable font can affect the way we interact with a computer.
  First order of business.

- Do something about the GNOME panel. The GNOME pannel (that would be
  all the status bars and such) by default takes a huge amount of
  screen space (particularly on smaller screens). For starters, I turn
  off "auto-expand" and move the top panel into the right or left
  corner, though there might be some advantage to moving it to the
  bottom left-or right corners, as we tend to have more horizontal
  space on our screens than vertical, but that depends a lot on your
  personal prefrence. My second move is to ditch the bottom pannel, and
  move things like the "multi-desktop" chooser, and a drop down list of
  open windows to the top pannel. Move things that you use every day to
  the pannel and take away things that you don't need to see. One of
  the reasons that I like OS X so much is that it does a pretty good
  job of focusing the UI on "content" inside the window, rather than
  the UI of the window/system itself. GNOME can do this too, but it
  doesn't automatically.

- This is an elaboration of the earlier too points, but tweak the theme
  settings, which--at least in Ubunut--are cartoonish by default. I've
  found that the "Mist" interface buttons tend to take up a little less
  room, but try your hand at desiging something new. My M.O. of late
  has revolved around "making everything smaller" because I don't like
  UI bloat, but no matter what your goals are, I think everyone needs
  to spend some time customizing the finer aspects of their UI.

It's a start in the right dirrection at any rate.

Onward and Upward!
