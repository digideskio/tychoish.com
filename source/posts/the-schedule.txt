Wow. Hello blog.

I'm pretty busy. It even seems sort of cliche to complain about such
things on ones blog, but I think being busy has coincided with a
somewhat larger reevaluation of nearly everything.

Wait, no. I'm not quitting blogging.

I'm actually really proud of the `Knowing
Mars <http://tychogaren.com/mars/>`__ launch, and it feels really good
to have that project "done," even if I think it needs a major revision,
and I have a lot more fiction on my plate that I don't want to just "let
go" like that.

I'm also somewhat displeased with the kind of blog posts that I've been
writing recently. It seems that I've been writing about some basic
ideas: my disdain for the way the web functions as a user interface,
some general work flow topics, some basic cyber-culture topics, and half
way through most of these blog posts I mostly loose interest, and I
suspect you have as well.

I've had a post in my "write this soon list," about digging in deeper
and striving for a more rich engagement with the topics I try and cover
here, and I've pretty much failed with that. In any case, this post was
supposed to be more about the things that are on my schedule:

I've been doing a lot offline these past few weeks. It's May and that
means it's Morris Dancing season. I seem to have joined an interesting
phenomena called "Maple Morris," (more reflection on that when I've
processed a bit more,) the usual Mayday festivities, Midwest Morris Ale.
And then there are a bunch of singing conventions, which are a great
deal of fun and fulfilling, and then there are contra dancing *things*,
but none of these things transmit to quiet weekends alone writing. Or
even quiet evening around writing. At least very often. Some highlights
of the recent past and near future:

-  Maple Morris; A my-generation Morris dancing event, last weekend in
Boston. A bunch of Morris dancers in my general age rage got together
to dance some really challenging dances and to sing great songs. I
was totally overwhelmed.

-  The Midwest Morris Ale; My regular annual Morris dancing ale. This is
my 9th consecutive ale (and my 10th anniversary of dancing Morris.)

-  Since last September, I've gone to an all- or mulit- day Sacred Harp
singing convention most months, since last September, and there's one
on my calender every month between now and this September.

-  I'm going to "`Youth Dance
Weekend <http://youthdanceweekend.org/>`__\ " in Vermont in
September, which I've never been to, but I think it'll be a a great
deal of fun, and I'm very much looking forward to it. I've not been
contra dancing as much, but that's not a huge problem for me.

-  I'm moving to Philadelphia in the summer, which means a drastically
longer commute, but an easier to orchestrate social life, and a
better work/life balance. This means apartment hunting and all that
jazz.

While this means less writing time and time for taking care of my own
projects, it doesn't mean that I don't have any writing time. Sure
writing takes time, but the largest challenge as a writer is in using
the time I/we already have effectively, and getting the most out of
those opportunities.

It also, I think, means finding a way to develop a writing (and
blogging) habit that:

-  Doesn't revolve around a fixed daily publication schedule. I still
want to write essays, but I need to write essays when I have a
compelling argument for an essay, rather than around the same core of
ideas that I've been running around for the last year.

-  I need to be able to put the blog on the back burner while I focus on
things like writing fiction, or hacking projects, or Cyborg Institute
stuff. The blog is great, and I love writing the blog, but It's far
to easy for me to fall into a pattern where the blog becomes **the**
project, rather than the journal in support of the project.

-  I need to organize my projects and tasks into clumps of work that are
easier to manage in shorter periods of time. This is probably a
reorganization problem that needs to mostly occur within my head.

So where does that leave us? I have a few posts piled up that I'll
parcel out over the next few weeks, though on the whole there will
probably be less posting by me around here. I'm probably going to do
more posts along the lines of "here's what I've been up to, go read my
work elsewhere." There will be some guest posts and I've already begun
working with some writers for that. Beyond that, I guess we'll both be
able to be surprised.
