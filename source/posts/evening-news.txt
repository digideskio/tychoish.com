My grandmother watches the evening news, which isn't particularly
noteworthy except that it's not something that *I* do unless I'm near
someone who does. I tend to get my news via the radio, and the Internet,
and while the visuals are instructive, it's not something that I've had
a lot of experience watching in recent years.

Which is why I was surprised by how *bad* they've gotten in the past few
years. Not only is the news shorter, but there's less variation in the
coverage (all the networks/shows cover the same half dozen stories, with
much the same slant.) And there's this pervasive inline advertising
thing which I swear is a new phenomena. It's unsettling at the very
least.

ps. I also correctly diagnosed a case of spasmodic disphonia in they
junior senator from main on the television.
