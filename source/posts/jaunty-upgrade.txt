jaunty upgrade

So I've upgraded to the latest version of Ubuntu, 9.04 "Jaunty
Jackalope," and I thought I'd post some thoughts on the matter.

On my desktop the upgrade (eg. ``sudo apt-get dist-upgrade``) was a bit
touch and go, but I managed to save things (logging in running the old
kernel into a root shell to fix the upgrade which mysteriously held back
some packages it shouldn't have) and here I am. The laptop was easier to
upgrade, and I suspect this has something to do with the blob video card
drivers I'm using on the desktop.

On the whole, I can't say I've toyed with the updates to gnome terribly
much so I don't know what to say, but I suspect that they are in fact
newer, better, and worthwhile if you're using intrepid and or interested
in trying out ubuntu. It's really a great OS, and it does a great
job--in my experience--of just working with minimal fussing.

I'm not sure that I'd choose an Ubuntu distribution again knowing what I
know today. At the same time, I don't know that I'd know as much as I do
about Linuxes today without it, and given that this still works, I'm not
switching.

My jaunty upgrade, however, inspired a few changes to my setup, and I'm
*quite* happy with those improvements. They are:

- I switched to using rxvt-unicode as a terminal emulator (I had been
using gnome-terminal). I really like this, because the terminal is
low resource (and can run demonized, so you can have a lot of windows
open). It's hard as hell to setup (in my experience,) but `you can
learn from my .Xdefaults
file <http://dotfiles.org/~tychoish/.Xdefaults>`__ if you're
interested.

- I started (finally) using gnome-color-chooser and gtk-chtheme (debian
package names) to remove gnome-settings-daemon from my list of
background programs, while still having windows that don't look like
1992.

- I stopped using vimperator in firefox, opting instead for firemacs
(to control keybindings) and LoL for keyboard navigation (hit-a-hint
links). Having access to the Awesome bar is a good thing indeed.

Still on the list of things to update?

- I need to upgrade to the latest awesome version, as I'm behind.

- I need to actually ditch gdm, which irritates me still.
