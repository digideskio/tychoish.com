Tea Review: Yorkshire Tea
=========================

This is a tea review that I should have written a long time ago, but
I've been putting it off, for one reason or another. And then I realized
that the box was almost empty. I guess I like it.

The tea is Taylors and Harrogate's "Yorkshire Tea." I think they make a
"Yorkshire Gold" blend which may be different. I got this in bags; but
you might find it in some other form. This past time was also the second
time that I've gotten it, again, another good sign.

I've also, with this tea, learned a powerful lesson. Brew strong and add
milk. This stuff is sturdy enough (as most English style black teas)
that it requires milk no matter what, which means brew it as strong as
you can, and then add milk (rather than try and find the sweet spot
where you can manage it without milk, because you're too lazy to add
milk. The result is pretty invariably a good cup.

Particularly so with this. It's strong, there's lots of flavor, "robust"
I guess they call it, but there's no bite (so "smooth.") I don't really
have the proper linguistic tools for discussing this, with "notes" and
what not, which I always found foolish anyway. There are a lot of teas
that are pretty good but there's an element of the taste that just feels
a bit off, and that's delightfully not the case here. On the upside

I think the next up is the same company's english breakfast tea. I'm
excited about this. Really I am.

Onward and Upward!
