Test Taking Strategies

I have a lot of memories of being the last person in the class during
tests. It was almost embarrassing, mostly because always felt that the
people who got done so much earlier did a lot better than me. These
days, however, I get to questions that I don't know on tests, and I'm
like "well here's my best shot," and then I'm done, without the
fretting, and the stress. Is that what everyone else has been doing
since the 3rd grade and I'm just now catching on?
