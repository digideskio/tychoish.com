Hey folks,

Today, 8 March 2008, for one hour I'm going to be doing the local
Eastern European/etc folk music show on our community radio station
while the host is returning from a shape note singing convention.

My "concept" for this show is the play some Scandinavian and
Scandi-inspired tunes, followed by a series of tunes that covers the
dialogue between anglo and irish folk music and chamber music.

Enjoy
