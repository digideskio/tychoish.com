Welcome to this new little blog/wiki project. I made a post to `critical
futures <http://criticalfutures.com/>`__ about reorganizing the way I
did my blog comments and blogging called `a modest blogging
proposal <http://criticalfutures.com/2010/12/a-modest-blogging-proposal/>`__.

I wrote this post a few weeks ago. I was so inspired by the prospect of
reorganizing the blog, and also so frustrated by the less-than-useful
structure of my blogging that, I did the "big reorganization" of the
blog the very same day that I published the post that started it all.

This proves, it seems, the neccessity of these changes, which are:

- Moving the "dialectical futurism" blog to my "`Critical Futures
  <http://criticalfutures.com>`__\ " domain, as an "essay" blog. I'm
  planning to post a new essay here every Tuesday. I might also add a
  second day a week for some other feature (podcast?  contributed
  essay?)

- Move the "wikish" wiki that I'd been hosting on the "tychoish.com"
  domain to *be* tychoish.com, and add a more short-form blog to the
  "blog/wiki." I'm calling it "Rhizomatics," and this is the first
  post. I'll be writing here pretty regularly, and with less intense
  posts.

- Do all of the above in a way that doesn't break all of the existing
  links.

And I think I've done it all. I'll be doing some tweaking in the next
few days and weeks to make it all work a bit better, but
suggestions are always welcome.

Stay tuned!
