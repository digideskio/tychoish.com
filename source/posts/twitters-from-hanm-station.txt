I'll be posting an essay on Deleuze in a few moments, so sit tight. I
think you'll enjoy. I have a few things to report.

I prepped to write another Deleuze essay. I did some checking and if I
proceed at my current pace, I should be done with chapter 2 by the end
of the summer. There'll be a hiatus of sorts, and if I'm still
interested we'll use the break to explore something non-Deleuze.

In other, *Station Keeping* news, "I've" started a twitter microblog,
for station keeping. I'll post SK updates and also little notes from the
characters. It will appear in the sidebar, with the tag "Twitter /
Station Keeping" For your entertainment pleasure.
