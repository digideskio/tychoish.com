Once again, I'm going to reply to a post that Jeff Kirvin has made in my
own blog, because I'm too lazy to register to post on his. Forgive me
Jeff:

`Is Apple crazy like a
fox? <http://www.jeffkirvin.net/2007/07/07/is-apple-crazy-like-a-fox/#comments>`__:

Okay, by now you guys know I’m not a fan of the iPhone. There are
some things I like about it (battery life, durability, music UI) but
I don’t think it’s a very good phone. The lack of 3G, inexplicable
inconsistencies in the UI (different themes, different gesture
effects) and the crippled Bluetooth profiles make the iPhone a
non-starter for me. But what if there’s a method to the madness? Bob
Cringely has an interesting column up where he talks about how Steve
Jobs should know better than to release a device on hype alone:

We’ve all heard that the iPhone shipped with EDGE because the
battery drain from current 3G chips was too high. But what if that’s
a smokescreen? The iPhone’s battery life is off the charts, and a
lot of the problems the iPhone has could be fixed by moving to 3G.
Not just the data speed, but 3G allows a better voice codec as well,
meaning better call quality. Add the bump to 3G to “fixes” to the UI
consistency, minor bug fixes (why do you really think every Apple
employee got an iPhone? product testing) and roll it all out the
same time as Leopard, just in time for the Xmas shopping frenzy. And
you could also use that opportunity to add things like
copy-and-paste and the iWork office suite that is supposedly the
real delay in getting Leopard out the door.

(from `JeffKirvin.net <http://www.jeffkirvin.net>`__.)

I think it's pretty clear that 3G isn't something that can be done in
firmware, so that hope's out, but your other complaints: UI
consistencies, bluetooth, etc. *are* things that can be changed with a
forced (or not) update, and things that I suspect will be changed. Also,
I suspect that in October when Leopard ships, we'll see some
improvements to other complaints: note syncing and ToDo's seem like
logical first steps, but I also have to imagine that we'll see some sort
of 3rd party widgets at some point.

Some sort of iPhone-WikityWidget, or just about anything that `the
OmniGroup <http://www.omnigroup.com/>`__ could write, I think would make
folks like Jeff and me really happy.

My prediction: a firmware update coming soon, Leopard and a slightly
beefed up Phoneless-iPhone in time for x-mas, and iphone v2.0 ready by
MacWorld next year.

cheers!
