=========================
wordpress and abstraction

I realize this is kind of meta, but....

since I'm setting up two new Wordpress installations on this sever, for
this website and also for the station keeping documentation, I've
realized that there is so much that the software can do and so little
that I generally get it to do, and about 80% of what I do do with
wordpress, are hacked together things from the old days.

I mean I think it all looks good, and what not, and I don't really want
to make the website(s) any spiffier than they already are, but.... it's
craziness.

Also, I have to say that, while it works really well, Wordpress is kind
of getting bloated and funny. Back in the day, you could open up the
files (I guess this was back when it was
`b2/cafelog <http://cafelog.com/>`__) and see what the database queries
were doing. A discussion I had with
`bear <http://code-bear.com/bearlog/2004/10/>`__, gave me the term
"abstraction" to describe the way that computer code/programing becomes
further and further removed from what it's actually doing. I hope I'm
getting that right...

Anyway, I had a blogging system for a while, where all the templates and
what not, basically had to be done by hand. While we didn't work out
perfectly for each-other, that CMS and I, in terms of capability, there
isn't a lot that it couldn't do that I can now with the a program that
is significantly newer (as these things go).

well whatever.

ps. I'm using the `BlogMate <http://www.ditchnet.org/blogmate/>`__
plugin for TextMate this post. Have I mentioned how much I like
`TextMate <http://macromates.com/>`__
