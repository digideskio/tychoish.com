I wrote a series of posts `about setting up my new work
computer <http://www.tychoish.com/2009/07/new-workstation-trials>`__ as
a way to avoid blathering on and on about how the movers *lost the
cushions for my couch*, and other assorted minutia that seem to dominate
my attention. What these posts didn't talk about were what I was doing
for "tychoish" and related computing.

About a week and some change, before I moved, I packed up my desktop
computer and started using my laptop full time. It's small, portable,
and sufficient, if not particularly speedy.

I can do everything with the laptop (a ThinkPad x41t, which is a
2005-vintage 12" tablet) that I can do on any other computer I use, and
while I often prefer it because small screen means that it's really easy
to focus intently on writing *one thing* at a time. This, inversely,
means that it doesn't work very well for research intensive work, where
I need to switch between contexts regularly. It's a fair trade off, and
I did OK for weeks.

But then, having been in town for two and a half weeks, I decided it was
time to break down and get my personal desktop setup and working. And
it's amazing. The thing, works just as well as it always has (which is
pretty good,) and it's nice to have a computer at home that I can do
serious writing on, and the extra screen space is just perfect. I've
been able to be much more productive and comfortable with *my own*
projects since this began.

There are some things that I need to address with this computer, that
have been queuing up. In the spirit of posting my todo lists for the
world to see...

- I need to get a new keyboard. My "fancy" "`Happy Hacking Lite
2 <http://pfuca-store.stores.yahoo.net/>`__\ " keyboard is at work,
as I'm comfortable with it, I do a *lot* of writing at work, and I
set up that keyboard first (and the current default Mac keyboard
sucks.)

I'm thinking of either, getting another Happy Hacking keyboard, or more
likely at this point, getting a `das keybaord
ultimate <http://www.daskeyboard.com/>`__ because how could I turn down
blank keys and variable-pressure mechanical switch keys. And writing is
what I do, so totally worth it.

- I need to install Arch on this computer. I feel like cruft is
beginning to accumulate here, I've never quite been happy with the
ubutnu experience, and there are some things that I can't get to work
right (namely mounting of USB-mass storage devices) My concerns are
that getting dual monitors setup on this box was *a royal pain*. But
that might have been ubuntu related. I'm not sure.

- My current thought is that I'll buy a new (small) hard drive (eg. 80
gigs) to run a clean operating system install on (arch) and then use
the current drive as storage for the stuff that's already there
(music, video). But I might just get a larger additional drive and do
it in reverse. I dunno. The current situation isn't that bad, and I
think that I'll archify the laptop first.

Annnyway...
