`This post on writing <http://justinelarbalestier.com/blog/?p=890>`__
has made it's rounds on the SF writing blog circuit today ([John
Scalzi](http://scalzi.com/") and `Tobias
Buckell <http://www.tobiasbuckell.com/>`__;
`here <http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=268,>`__, and
`here <http://www.tobiasbuckell.com/2008/01/03/rewriting/>`__,) and I've
been thinking about it a bunch.

So I'm posting it here, because I think its a good resource, and it's
interesting.

As a blogger myself, I'm not sure that I have anything substantive to
add to this discussion other than to say it's interesting and to ask you
what you think...

The other thing that's been weighing on my mind with regards to
revisions and copy, is `the blog of deanna
hoak <http://deannahoak.com/>`__, a SF-specializing copy-editor.

Copy quality is something I worry about a lot. With reason, I mean you
all read a bunch of pretty rough copy that I put out here. At the same
time I think I'm generally better than I used to be, though you can of
course come to your own conclusion.

At the same time I'm pretty good at getting the structural level squared
away, or at least being sensitive to this.

*shrug* one word at a time, one day at a time.

Onward and Upward!
