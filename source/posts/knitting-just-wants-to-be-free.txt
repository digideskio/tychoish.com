`Open Source Knitting: Part
1 <http://tychoish.com/posts/osk-open-knitting/>`__

This is the first installment in a new series for TealArt that I wrote
about knitting and the knitting community, and it's connections to the
open source community.

I'm mostly posting this notification here so that ravelry types can see
it, but I think it's an interesting idea.

I'm going to go try and pull my day together...

cheers, tycho
