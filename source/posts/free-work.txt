*There's a folk song with the line "let the toast go free," to which an
assembled crowd of singers will often stand up and cry "free the toast!"
in response.*

I've been spending the morning going through email, reading feeds,
tweaking some of the issues raised in the site improvements page, and trying
to rock *getting things done*. In the mean time I have a few links to
share.

- `The Everyday Lives Of Video Game
  Developers <http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/viewArticle/73/76>`__

- `The Price of
  Free <http://www.socialtextjournal.org/periscope/2009/11/the-price-of-free-1.php>`__
- This article, and the one before, are both open on my "things to
  read list. Imagine that's what I'm doing this afternoon.

- `Branchable <http://www.branchable.com/>`__ - ikiwiki (like the wiki
  that powers this site) hosting service, based on publicly available
  tools. I kinda want to set up a branchable instance.

- `Pybtex <http://pybtex.sourceforge.net/>`__ - a python/yaml drop in
  replacement for BibTeX, which is really cool, and I suspect that this
  will probably be my next citation management tool. I've been looking
  for one for a long time.

- `Kindle Feeder <http://kindlefeeder.com/>`__ - a tool to crawl your
  feeds and move them to your kindle. I'm currently sifting through my
  feeds and seeing what might make sense to read on the kindle. Might
  as well, and the automatic delivery makes a lot of sense.

- I played with
  `ehsell <http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryEshell>`__ for the
  first time today in response to `this
  post <http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2010/12/13/complete-guide-mastering-eshell/>`__,
  and I have to say that I really like it, and it's *much* more
  intuitive and usable than I thought it'd be. I like the idea of being
  able to write shell functions in emacs-lisp. As an aside the post is,
  I think, an example of really great casual technical writing.
