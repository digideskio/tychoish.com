*Overheard Last night...* > A: BigImportant University has two Ph.D
programs: one in English and one in Literature.

R: What's the difference?

A: The website says, that the professors in the English program are
interested in literature, and the people in the literature program...
aren't as much.

Sigh.

It's funny. But it's also true. The Literature is more theoretical and
in with the "cultural studies" paradigm. So it makes sense, but it leads
to funny statements like that.

Sigh.

Carry on.
