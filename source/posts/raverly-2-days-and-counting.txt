I checked back on raverly, and there are 473 people in front of me.
Depending on how tierlessly they work through the weekend... I'll be in
by next week. huzzah.

Guess I'm going to have to take the wireless router on vacation with me.

Still don't have a plan for the future of TealArt/Tychoish/tycho on the
internet.

Still haven't finnished the paper on animal communication.

Back to the salt mines.

Cheers, sam
