===================================
Anyone up for a Sweater Knit Along?
===================================

Hey folks,

Last night I despite not having finished my previous sweater (the hem,
it pains me) I sat down and figured out the design for my next sweater.

Anyway. I've wanted to host a knit-a-long for a long time, and I figure
there's no time like the present right?

So assuming you're up for it, I'll get some files together later
today/tomorrow with the charts and we can get started.

You'll need about 1200 yards/12oz - ish each of two (contrasting) colors
of jumper-weight (fingering) yarn, with full disclosure that prediction
is rough.

Because while I've knit many sweaters like this, I've never made *this*
sweater yet. So it'll be an adventure for you. I have an inch done, so I
should be a little bit ahead of you, intrepidly figuring out any of the
errors in the pattern before you get there. It's sort of like the
`fearless fair isle project <http://wendyjohnson.net/fairisle/>`__ that
`Wendy <http://wendyknits.net/>`__ did several years ago, only more,
well, tychoish.

Anybody game? Tell your friends and stay tuned!

Onward and Upward!
