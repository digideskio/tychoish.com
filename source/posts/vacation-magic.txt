The Magic of Vacation
=====================

I've been on vacation this week, if that wasn't clear to you all.
There's been a lot of "doing things," notably this website, a nifty
lunch at a big tech company you've heard of, family stuff, bumming
around New York City with R., and writing seemingly thousands of emails
regarding projects, events, and possible meetings that I will probably
not have time to commit to or maintain once I return to my regular
routine. But it feels good to be able to pay attention to all sorts of
work that I'm forced to neglect most of the time.

I really like this new wiki, and I really like the new publishig work
flow, the way that [[people have interacted with the
site\|site-improvements]] n and the ability to blog *casually* again.
Here are some exciting links/thoughts:

- `Willie Taylor <http://cl.ly/280s3m0B0h0c1W0o0H31>`__, an
  English/Irish folk song, sung in this version by a couple of friends
  at Bard College (Jeremy Carter-Gordon and Ben Bath). It's nice to
  know that I'm not the only person in my generation who's into this
  kind of music

- `pinboard.in <http://pinboard.in>`__, a delicious (rip) like,
  link-sharing/storing service. The thing I like most about Pinboard
  (I have an account, but I don't really use it.) is that they charge
  a nominal fee for creating an account. This supports the site and
  controls who gets an account. While I'm not sure I like a world
  where content/services on the web are all pay-to-play, I *really*
  don't like the world where no one is willing to pay for anything
  digital, because there's an expectation that things ought to be
  free.

- I wrote about `this
  <http://criticalfutures.com/2009/09/the-mainframe-of-the-future/>`__
  more than a year ago, but I think that `halvm <http://halvm.org/>`__
  (an implementation of Haskell that runs on bare Xen) is really cool,
  and probably an indicator of things to come, but it'll be a while
  before this (and other tools like it) are really ready for general
  use. Which is probably a good thing because engineers and IT people
  need some time to adapt to thinking about software in this way.

Keep warm!
