Despite my recent graduation, I'm taking classes this semester. In part
to "stay in shape" and maintain a student like mindset, and in part
because I'm at a stage where I find it hard to do academic in my field
of choice independently, and I'm totally ok with that.

Having said this, I've come to a conclusion. I don't need to take notes
in any particular sort of way. Today in class we got the "intro to
cognition" lecture that I've seen a thousand times. And I dutifully
wrote down what working memory is, as if I'd never seen it before.

Sometimes not taking notes is better than actually taking them, I think.

This, at least for the moment, is one of those times.
