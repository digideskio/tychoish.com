Although I forget it, sometimes, the following video is probably the
single best piece of advice for better blogging. Watch the video:

`Cory Docotorow - How to be an Uber

Attention and time are scarce while content is plentiful. "If you write
it they'll read" cannot, thus, be true of blogging. Interesting and
important content is interesting, but success lies in managing the
attention economy and focusing on output that is *easy* to read and easy
to skim. Its not glamorous, and it requires giving up a bunch of pride,
but writers must write with readers in mind.

I'll skip the meandering analysis and get to a couple of key questions
that I think remain open, even 4 years after this video was posted:

-  What about non-newsreel blogs? Blogs that are more analysis and less
regurgitation's of boingboing/metafilter/slashdot?

-  What about non-blog content? Are books and articles, subject to the
same overload (yes?) but are the solutions always "write easy to
process, easy to skip," content? (Maybe?)

-  The connection between the "attention" economy, evolving search
engine use patterns, and mobile technology change the way that we
interact with and compensate for overload?
