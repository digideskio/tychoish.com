As I continue to adjust to the new computer, I'm realizing that there's
something I want to be doing my computer that I don't quite have the
tools and/or cognitive capacity for.

I've sometimes joked that I have no business having such a powerful
computer because the truth is that 80% or more of my digital work is a
dealing with text files, plain text files that are technologically the
same as text files from 30 years ago. *For this we don't need a dual
core processors, or 250 gigabyte hard drives.*

But this is a digression. Probably the second biggest (in terms of
import) collection of *stuff* I have on this computer is data and texts
of one form or another. Lots of PDFs of academic articles and resources,
lots of notes of my own creation, that sort of thing.

While I've tried almost all of the "personal database" managers over the
past few years, I settled on using an interesting solution. That is
programs like DEVONthink Pro, Mori, EagleFiler, that attempt to provide
an additional layer of database management to all of the "things" in
your digital life. They're good programs, but the truth is that they all
provide a common set of very OS X-y tools, and they're all closed
source, and they tend to obscure the organization of the data. [1]_

I use `BibDesk <http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/>`__ to index all of the
published documents that I have on my computer, BibDesk is a great
program for managing citations and frankly I use it for a *lot* less
then its capable.

Anyway so there are a bunch of programs that do this kind of thing, and
I used `Devon Think <http://www.devontechnologies.com>`__ at one point
in the past, and I like it, but the database is proprietary and it's
having a problem with a file extension I use [2]_.

In any case here are a list of features that I consider important for
such a program and the task that I hope to accomplish with said
features:

- *Web Cliping* when I run across something on the internet that is
  important to a project I'm working on, I want to be able to capture
  it to the database for later reference. The clip should capture key
  bibliographic data (URL, time, title, etc.) and keep this exposed to
  me so I can easily incorporate the information into what I'm working
  on without needing to either have a connection to the internet or
  trace down the source for a second time.
- Mange *multiple formats*, including PDF, HTML, and plain text.
- Needs to *rely on external editing/viewing programs*. I really like
  the programs I use to edit files, and don't really want to use some
  special wrapper on top of TextEdit.
- Needs to keep the *data/files exposed* to the directory structure,
  and keep synchronized with this. If I change a file name/title in the
  database it needs to propagate down the line. DTP will *almost* do
  this, if you index files, but it means keeping a finder open window.
- *Something not Kludgey.* As I've been writing this, I managed to hack
  together a shell script that does like eighty percent of what I need
  (in concert with `ikiwiki <http://ikiwiki.info/>`__, which I already
  use), but it's ugly, and doesn't do a very good job of capturing the
  citation information automatically. If someone knows how to get a url
  for the top most safari window into the shell as a variable, this
  will obviously be a lot easier, as it is, I think I can hack it.

Is there some solution that people are using for this sort of task? Do
you have recommendations? I'd love to hear them.

.. [1] So, in part I'm predisposed to liking open source solutions, but in
   this case, it's particularly crucial, because I don't want to spend a
   lot of time working on organizing and managing the data in a database
   only to have that work obsoleted or destroyed when I want to move to
   another system/platform.

.. [2] I have plain text files with different file extensions for
   organizational purposes and what not.
