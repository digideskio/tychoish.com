of instant messaging...

While I'd probably be perfectly happy if the rest of the world subsisted
only on IRC and email for digital communication, I've long given up and
accepted the role of instant messengers in our lives. Nevertheless, I am
left with an important question:

While I think Jabber/Gtalk is probably ideal, I recognize that AIM
is a defacto standard. I'm not happy about this, but.... why doesn't
this platform after probably 10 years, have offline messaging? other
services have it, and have had it for ever. Hell, AOL bought and
integrated ICQ which had it, so why isn't there real support for it?

*end rant*
