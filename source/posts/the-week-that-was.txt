The Week that Was
=================

This has been a strange week. It's strange, but not terribly surprising,
that given a comparative expanse of free time with not a lot to do
except write, that every little thing I've meant to do for a while but
have been putting off suddenly came up and required all of my attention.

This isn't to say that I've spent all of my time doing chores and
running errands. I'm actually taking this as proof in favor of my
general theory that writing and other avocational pursuits ought to be
habitual and ongoing rather than the focus of occasional binges. But
there are some things that take a lot of time and its worth binging on a
little. This week, I got some writing done, but mostly did things like
tinkering with my computers and tending to some long overdue systems
administration tasks. I also switched to a new cell phone, oversaw
delivery of furniture, sang, danced, and cooked. Not a bad week.

I do have some links and notes for you.

- I made a rough introductory page for my efforts to [[run the xen
  hypervisor on a laptop\|xen-laptop]].

- There was some confusion this week as I reorganized the blog post
  files on the wiki. Basically, all blog posts are now in
  ``/rhizome/`` directory (no more ``/essay/`` and ``/rhizome/``) with
  the different feeds generated by tags. So I *did* post some cool
  stuff, but it didn't get out. This includes:

- [[Bad Org-Mode Habits\|bad-org-mode-habits]] about the best ways to
  use emacs' org-mode.

- [[Poetry Has a Purpose\|poetry-has-a-purpose]] which addresses a
  little bit of literary theory/criticism/practice that got under my
  skin and into my head.

- I've imported a few recent discussions from Facebook threads
  associated with my posts here onto [[discourse]] pages, which I
  think you might enjoy:

- [[Poetry's Purpose\|poetry-has-a-purpose/discourse]] and

- [[Leadership and
  Activism\|leadership-in-distributed-social-networks/discourse]].

- I spent some time this morning working on a system to capture notes
  into org-mode using procmail and my cellphone's email client. See
  that [[here\|code/org-mail]].

- Most of this post, excluding the links, was written on the
  aforementioned cell phone. It's still not quite the same as writing
  from a computer, but for getting raw material out of my head, I kind
  of like it. We'll see if that sticks.

That's about all I have for now!

The new job starts next week, so I would say that my posting schedule
may be a bit erratic. But if you've been reading *tychoish* for any
length of time, you're probably used to a far more irregular posting
pattern.

I'll see you on the flip side.
