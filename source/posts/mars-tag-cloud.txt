Mars Tag Cloud

So someone wrote a nifty little `java aplet <http://wordle.net/>`__ that
makes really pretty tag-cloud like graphics from either your
`delicious <http://del.icio.us/>`__ tags or from a block of your text.

So I plugged in the text of the novella that I wrote last fall into the
little window and got:

It's not very pretty, but it's sort of cool. And a little embarrassing,
but these things happen. I'll definitely be making more of these.

Thanks `amy <http://www.domesticat.net>`__ for the link to this. I agree
about putting these on shirts.

Hope your weekend is going well.

Out of curiosity, I copy and pasted the text of Cory Doctorw's *Someone
Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town* into the same applet and got the
following result.

"Said" is probably the most frequently non-determiner-word in fiction,
though I think I probably need to do something about my overuse of the
word "probably."

*sigh*
