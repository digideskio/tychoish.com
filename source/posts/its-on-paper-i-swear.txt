It's On Paper I Swear

So, I'm totally not keeping up with my tychoish blogging, like I want
to. Alas.

I haven't gotten started on the last chapter, but I think I'm getting a
little bit closer to that. Once I start it'll be pretty easy, I just
have to have a start.

I've been planning the next project, which is a good thing to do, so I'm
not exactly bemoaning lost productivity, because the next project needs
a lot more research and planning at the moment. I'm not going to do
NaNoWriMo, but using November 1 as a start date might not be a bad idea,
but I suspect I'll start sooner.

At the moment the planning I'm doing involves, get this: a lot of math.
Before I start a detailed outline, I want to have a good idea of how
long and where the major divisions in the story fall. What this means
for chapter break down, and the sort of "topographical shape" of the
story. Basically I'm trying to figure out pacing and that depends on
knowing how long the chapters are and how much story I can fit into
those divisions. It changes and shifts as the writing progresses, but
it's good to start with a plan.

(A scene in the novella that I planned for the 2nd chapter, appears in
chapter six, I think.)

So that's what I'm up to.

I also got a desk on craigslist, so it's at least a possibility that the
next post will be from the new offices for TealArt/tychoish/tycho.

Cheers!
