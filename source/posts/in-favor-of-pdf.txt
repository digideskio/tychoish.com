In Favor of PDF

This is really a short rant, and should come as a surprise to no one.

I hate DOC files, and RTF files, to say nothing of ODF, DOCX, and their
ilk because they have two necessarily conflicting properties:

1. They're oriented at producing documents on paper. Which is crazy.
Paper is an output, but it's not the only output in common use, so
it's nuts that generic document representation formats would be so
tightly coupled with paper.

2. The rendering of the content is editor specific, particularly with
regards to display options. If I compile a document and send it to
you, I have no guarantee whatsoever about the presentation or display
of the document on your system, particularly if I'm not certain that
your system is similarly configured. Particularly with respect to
fonts, page breaks, etc.

This is particularly idiotic with respect to 1.

It's not that PDF is great, or especially usable, but it's consistent
and behaves as expected. Furthermore, it does a good job of
appropriately expressing the limitations of paper.

So use PDF and accept no substitutions.
