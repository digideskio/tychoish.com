=======================
The Move to Open Source
=======================

Over the past several months, I've made a directed effort to rethink
which software packages I use on a daily basis and look for the most
efficient programs for particular tasks. Efficient both in terms of
usability, and computer resources one thing I've found is that in many,
though not all, of these ultimate programs are open source.

At the moment, the only proprietary programs I'm using (other than the
OS itself,) are: xtorrent, pukka, MarsEdit, TextMate, and NetNewsWire;
and I have to admit that NetNewsWire might be on it's way out (bad
livejournal support, and the interface is too big.) Also if xTorrent
freezes again, I may scream ahhhhh!!!!!

*Anyway,* just everything else is Open Source, and I'm really happy with
all these programs. I'm not fanatical or total about this move, and I
think it's good that I'm walking slowly in this direction.
