Mid May (Morris Slumps)

Hello friends,

I've been in something of a slump the past few days and really haven't
gotten things together to write in a couple of days. But never fear, I
have some entries backlogged, and I was able to sketch out a bit more
than a week's worth of posts, which I should be able to write pretty
quickly once I'm de-funk-ified.

Lets see what I have to report:

- Station Keeping is progressing, I think we'll start soon. It needs
  momentum, and it won't get it any other way.

- The `Midwest Morris Ale <http://s196623464.onlinehome.us/>`__ is in
  St. Louis this year, which means I'm part of the host team. I'll be
  doing that all weekend. If you're in the area, stop by tower grove
  park for the saturday tour, and say hi. You should be able to pick me
  out of a crowd... I'll be wearing white. (with black, yellow, and red
  ribbons).

- I just finished Samuel Delany's *The Einstein Intersection* which I
  quite enjoyed (particularly the ending, which I thought was quite
  well done. I also listened to an `Escape
  Pod <http://escapepod.org/guidelines/>`__, which I really like. After
  spending a few years at a school where the "science fiction and
  fantasy association" was the second largest student group (the first
  was the queer alliance, which I was one of the leaders for many
  semesters, but don't let that mislead you as to the ratio of geeks to
  queers), I'm back into it. I feel like I'm a better fan/consumer
  theses days. I'm working on James Tiptree Jr.'s *Brightness Falls
  From the Air* which is simply amazing work.

- I need to have my damned wisdom teeth taken out.

- I need to find a way to boost TealArt's readership. I thought that
  more regular posts would help this a bit, but it isn't really. My
  next move is to focus, at least my own posts a little. If you, any of
  you kind readers, have ideas about this. I'd love to hear about them.
  I've thought about pod-casting a little, but that's not something I
  want to do all by lonesome. Thinking...

- I'm going to try and rig up the next few posts. Wish me luck, and
  stay tuned. Have a good memorial day weekend!

Best, tycho
