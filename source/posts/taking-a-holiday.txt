I realized, I think, a bit too late in the process that `my last
post <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/mid-may-morris-slumps/>`__ really was
kind of the letter from the editor post for this week, even though I
posted it last thursday.

An update: (*actually there's not much, as I just wrote that other post
a few hours ago, like I said, morris dancing all weekend, and I won't be
done till later this afternoon by your reading.*)

- We've started to talk about a podcast option, I have some nifty
  ideas, and we'll see how that turns out.

- I hope you enjoyed the intro to the Deleuze series (I know in
  fairness I think it should be Deleuze and Guatteri, but I think of
  it as just Deleuze. attack me later). I've only written a few of
  them, but I quite enjoy the concept space. There's a lot of
  material, and I find it really fun to write about.

- The new TealArt plan: letter from the editor on monday, Station
  Keeping Tuesday, knitting/tychoBlathering on wednesday, ChrisTech
  Thursday, and Deleuze on Friday. It's rocking.

See you later in the week!

best, tycho
