How funny that I wrote about wanting a `Nokia
n800 <http://www.nseries.com/products/n800/>`__ this morning, just
before `apple <http://www.apple.com/>`__ releases the touch screen ipod
with wifi, that basically does the same thing, and is potentially
cheaper. Check out the coverage on engadget and other fine locations
throughout the interwebs.

The other ipods look spiffy, but I've not come to a situation where I
think upgrading for me would make sense. Having said that, one of the
new nanos looks like it would make a really ideal gift for someone who
might not need a full blown ipod, but would still like something more
than a shuffle.
