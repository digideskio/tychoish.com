========================
Because we have Potatoes
========================

I was looking through a notebook for some notes that I made concerning a
homework assignment, and discovered the following line lines of
memorable text:

"I don't think I'll go to the store tomorrow, too" she said
triumphantly.

"Ah," he replied without missing a beat in his crossword puzzle.

"Because we have potatoes." She declared, after a moment.

"That's good," he said, sounding far more exciting over a quantity
of root vegetable than anyone disserved to be, even if the crossword
puzzle was interesting.

Meanwhile their teenage son howled as he left the room fearing for
the future of the family menu plans.

Most interesting. Clearly it's something that happened in my house, but
I honestly can't remember it, and I also can't remember why I felt it
necessary to write down in my book.

Go figure. Anyway, back to the grindstone. I'll revert to human form on
Friday I think. I hope.
