September the 11th will always be remembered for the events in New York
City in the year 2001, but our remembrances on this date shouldn't be
dedicated solely the crimes of 2001.

On September 11, 1973 a Chilean man by the name of Victor Jara was
executed for writing and singing songs. After Pinochet and the other
Generals came to power they started killing those people who they felt
threatened by. Victor Jara was on the top of their list not only because
of support of Allende and the Popular Unity party, but because his songs
were political, and he had influence with the people.

They put him in prison where he began to sing to keep up the spirits of
himself and his fellow inmates. The guards broke his hands with their
rifle butts, but he continued to sing and write poems. On 9.11.73 Victor
Jara was takenóalong with five thousand other men to the soccer stadium
where he was tortured and eventually was murdered. There are reports
that say he sang until the very end, and I can believe it.

The following poem was the last that he wrote, on the morning of his
execution, in blood more or less, it was smuggled out of the stadium and
the translation you see here comes to us through Pete Seeger.

**Estadio Chile** **-Victor Jara**

We are 5,000 ó here in this little part of the city We are 5,000 ó
how many more will there be? In the whole city, and in the country
10,000 hands Which could seed the fields, make run the factories.
How much humanity ó now with hunger, pain, panic and terror?

There are six of us ó lost in space among the stars, One dead, one
beaten like I never believed a human could be so beaten. The other
four wanting to leave all the terror, One leaping into space, other
beating their heads against the wall All with gazes fixed on death.

The military carry out their plans with precision; Blood is medals
for them, Slaughter is the badge of heroism. Oh my God, is this the
world you created? Was it for this, the seven days, of amazement and
toil?

The blood of companero Presidente is stronger than bombs Is stronger
than machine guns. O you song, you come out so badly when I must
sing o the terror! What I see I never saw. What I have felt, and
what I feel must come out! "Hara brotar el momento! Hara brotar el
momento!"

There are some things that we can never be allowed to forget, words that
need to be said, and there are the songs of unsung hero's must be sung.
