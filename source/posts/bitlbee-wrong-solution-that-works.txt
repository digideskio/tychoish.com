Bitlbee, The Wrong Solution that Works
======================================

About a week ago, time of writing, I switched all of my instant
messaging to a little program called
`Bitlbee <http://www.bitlbee.org>`__. Basically this is a program that
runs locally as an IRC server and connects to various instant messaging
and "presence" protocols and exposes them to the end user client *as if
they were IRC*. Weird.

This is, emphatically, the wrong solution to the problem of finding a
sane technological solution to consuming real-time information (e.g.
instant messaging, twitter, xmpp, etc.) Previously, I'd been using an
XMPP-only client and running jabber-to-IM transports on the server,
which I think is more of a *right* solution. Why then did I switch?

- I wanted to use `irssi <http://www.irssi.org>`__, which I think `one
of the most cleverly designed and useful pieces of
software </2010/07/in-favor-of-simple-software>`__ out there.

- Transports that allow XMPP to interact with other services are an
ideal solution and I think the inclusion of transports in the design
of the XMPP protocol is a major selling point for the XMPP
technology. At the same time the most stable transports aren't
terribly stable and while there *could* be transport widgets for all
sorts of things there are only a few general purpose transports.

Practically speaking the jabber-to-AIM transport that I had been using,
had a habit of dying without cause once or twice a week, and it used a
lot of system resources for something that could (should?) have been
much simpler.

- The truth is that while XMPP is a nifty technology, and I really
enjoy using it, I'm starting to think that it's not ideal to expect
that XMPP replace IRC, as both accomplish different things for their
users. So while I always saw bitlbee as "giving into IRC" it's really
just an interface. And frankly IRC clients do IM better than IM
clients do IRC.

- Bitlbee works really well as a client for Facebook chat (which is a
weird XMPP flavor) and is a functional twitter client. With the
delight of using irssi, I'm able to really interact on these networks
without having to spend too much brain power sifting through crud.

So here I am. Switched. The buddy list on bitlbee leaves something to be
desired (but I have a particularly large buddy list) and I've yet to get
used to the syntax for creating and administering group chats inside of
bitlbee, but other than that? It's pretty rocking.

Onward and Upward!
