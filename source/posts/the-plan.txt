Hey friends!

So I might have mentioned that I'm going to `knitting
camp <http://www.schoolhousepress.com/>`__ at the end of the week. A
long drive on Thursday leaving *far* to early in the morning. Followed
by four whole days of intensive knitting, and then a drive back. As a
result the blog schedule will be a bit--disrupted. Last year when I was
at camp I posted a fair piece, and I suspect that I'll want to
opportunity to recount camp stories a bit as they happen.

At the same time, I *probably* won't have the time to do my usual
writing cram over the weekend to make sure that there are fun and
interesting posts for you during the week. So here's the deal:

- There'll be new `critical futures <http://criticalfutures.com/>`__
  stories posted every weekday for the next two weeks. *This won't
  change*, fear not. - I'll post new things here, through the weekend.

- I'll probably take a brief tychoish vacation for a couple of days
  next week, I think there'll be three posts, but I'm not sure when
  they'll hit yet. It's a blog, after all. Don't be worried.

--------------

Because I doubt that administrivia is what you all came here to read, I
think I'll pass along some links and thoughts and questions that you
might enjoy.

- The cats are still nibbling toes. This remains *not cute,* though
  they haven't gotten this memo yet.

- Though I'm only really interested in talking about electoral
  politics in the `historical sense
  <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/johnson-or-bush/>`__, or as a venue for
  placing friendly bets, [1]_ but I'm not going to lie `this is funny
  <http://seantevis.com/kansas/3000/running-for-office-xkcd-style/>`__.
  "*This is the **internet**!*\ " heh. Actually I'm more worried that
  someone has cracked `Randall's <http://xkcd.com/about/>`__ secret
  sauce

- A `git-wiki <http://atonie.org/2008/02/git-wiki>`__ that really
  rocks. It's still early on development, and it's lacking some
  features that would make it useable *for me* at the moment, but I
  can totally see a place for such a thing for some future projects.

- The ruby guys are totally awesome, and I like a lot of ruby
  projects, and I think that in some ways ruby is going to be the
  "next php," even I have a soft spot in my heart [2]_ for Python, but
  I said to `chris <http://www.cgkreality.com/>`__ the other day that
  "ruby is the visual basic of our generation."

- I'm thinking of starting to hard wrap columns in my text files,
  because it would make running diffs and file histories easier,
  grepping is easier, it makes the text more spatially consistent, it
  would make using vim easier, and so forth but I seem to *really*
  enjoy changing the window size a lot, and `he
  <http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2008/01/window-wrapping-in-textmate/>`__
  is probably right, there's *very little* practical value, and
  hitting ^Q for a vestige seems ill advised. That doesn't mean I
  won't try it, you read my post about my email after all.

- I just finished reading "`Star Surgeon podiobooks
  <http://www.podiobooks.com/title/star-surgeon>`__," a delightfully
  quirky public domain science fiction novel by Alan E.  Norse, and
  read by my friend `Scott Farquhar <http://www.scottfarquhar.com/>`__
  of `Promethesus Radio Theatre <http://prometheus.libsyn.com/>`__,
  which was delightful even if it wasn't a fine example of tightly
  structured prose. Scott's next book is `"Black Star Passes" by
  John W.  Campbell
  <http://www.podiobooks.com/title/black-star-passes/>`__, which I
  intend to start while I'm driving to camp.

.. [1] I have, for months been trying to figure out what the bet *is*
   for the various party's VP candidate. It's a fun game, because its
   not an ideological discussion, but it's almost always very
   historically grounded. It also calls attention to the deeply
   farcical nature of the entire performance.

.. [2] and brain, as well, actually, because damned if I can really
   make it do anything--that's not true, but it feels like it
   sometimes--but I do love the concept of and rationale for python.
