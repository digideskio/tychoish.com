I don't know if I ever get to say this much, but my favorite episode of
*firefly* is probably "War Stories," but I never get to watch it with
people. sigh.

if there are any firefly fans (browncoats) out there, but.... I'm
showing/sharing firefly to/with a friend. We watched "serenity" last
week, and this week I can' decided to go in order and show "train job"
or skip and watch "shindig," or "jayne's town." Help would be
appreciated.
