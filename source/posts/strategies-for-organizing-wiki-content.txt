I've been trying to figure out wikis for a long time. It always strikes
me that the wiki is probably the first truly unique (and successful)
textual form of the Internet age. And there's a lot to figure out. The
technological innovation of the wiki is actually remarkably
straightforward, [1]_ and while *difficult* the community building
aspects of wikis are straightforward. [2]_ The piece of the wiki puzzle
that I can't nail down in a pithy sentence or two is how to organize
information effectively on a wiki.

That's not entirely true.

The issue, is I think that there are a number of different ways to
organize content for a wiki, and no one organizational strategy seems to
be absolutely perfect, and I've never been able to settle on a way of
organizing wiki pages that I am truly happy with. The goals of a good
wiki "information architecture" (if I may be so bold) are as follows:

- **Clarity:** It should be immediately clear to the readers and
  writers of a wiki where a page should be located in the wiki. If
  there's hierarchy, it needs to fit your subject area *perfectly* and
  require minimal effort to grok. Because you want people to focus on
  the content rather than the organization, and we don't tend to focus
  on organizational systems when they're clear.

- **Simplicity:** Wikis have a great number of internal links and can
  (and are) indexed manually as needed, so as the proprietor of a wiki
  you probably need to do a lot less "infrastructural work" than you
  think you need to. Less is probably more in this situation.

- **Intuitive:** Flowing from the above, wikis ought to strive to be
  intuitive in their organization. Pages should answer questions that
  people have, and then provide additional information out from there.
  One shouldn't have to dig in a wiki for pages, if there are
  categories or some sort of hierarchy there pages there shouldn't be
  overlap at the tips of various trees.

Strategies that flow from this are:

- In general, write content on a very small number of pages, and
  expand outward as you have content for those pages (by chopping up
  existing pages as it makes sense and using this content to spur the
  creation of new pages.

- Use one style of links/hierarchy (`wikish </wikish>`__ and `ciwiki
  <http://wiki.cyborginstitute.com>`__ fail at this.) You don't want
  people to think: Should this be a camel case link? Should this be a
  regular one word link? Should this be a multiple word link with dash
  separated words or underscore separated words? One convention to
  rule them all.

- Realize that separate hierarchies of content within a single wiki
  effectively create separate wikis and sites within a single wiki,
  and that depending on your software, it can be non-intuitive to link
  between different hierarchies.

- As a result: use as little hierarchy and structure as possible.
  hierarchy creates possibilities where things can go wrong and where
  confusion can happen. At some point you'll probably need
  infrastructure to help make the navigation among pages more
  intuitive, but that point is *always* later than you think it's
  going to be.

- Avoid reflexivity. This is probably generalizable to the entire
  Internet, but in general people aren't very interested in how things
  work and the way you're thinking about your content organization.
  They're visiting your wiki to learn something or share some
  information, not to think through the meta *crap* with you. Focus on
  that.

- Have content on all pages, and have relatively few pages which only
  serve to point visitors at other pages. Your main index page is
  probably well suited as a traffic intersection without additional
  content, but in most cases you probably only need a very small
  number of these pass through pages. In general, make it so your
  wikis have content everywhere.

... and other helpful suggestions which I have yet to figure out. Any
suggestions from wiki maintainers?

.. [1] There are a number of very simple and lightweight wiki engines,
   including some that run in only a few lines of Perl. Once we had
   the tools to build dynamic websites (CGI, circa 1993/1994), the
   wiki became a trivial implementation.

.. [2] The general Principal of building a successful community edited
   wiki is basically to pay attention to the community in the early
   stages.  Your first few contributors are very important, and
   contributions have to be invited and nurtured, and communities
   don't just happen.  In the context of wikis, in addition to
   supporting the first few contributors, the founders also need to
   construct a substantive *seed* of content.
