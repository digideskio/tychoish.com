Ideas in Science Fiction

I `love Nancy Kress' blog <http://nancykress.blogspot.com/>`__. Just
saying. If you don't read it, start. It's good stuff.

She wrote the other day about `her approach to developing SF
stories <http://nancykress.blogspot.com/2008/12/probably-big-mistake.html>`__
and I wanted to explore her little hint in more depth here. First, a
quote from the conclusion:

The larger point here is that, in my view, SF should be more than
its "idea." I am not writing about a "galactic empire" or about
aliens who "lord" anything over humans. It may be that my story
fails on these other literary dimensions -- character, emotion,
human insight, moral implication -- as well.

Of course she's correct. The best SF stories deal with a lot of literary
dimensions, many conventional--emotions, character development,
morality, and insight--and many less conventional--aliens, technology,
and space. At the same time, I don't think it's quite fair to dismiss
"the idea" (the science fictional aspects) as being sort of secondary.
While I can appreciate that our main goals for writing science fiction
isn't to deal with things like spaceships and alien worlds, the
boundaries between the aspects of any given science fiction story that
are "the literary core" and the literary features that are just
background, are difficult to draw.

On the one hand the combination of a traditional literary core and "the
extra stuff," is what makes SF so special. While space ships can be
distracting, these and other aspects of a story create all sorts of
situations that make the "core literary" material possible or
interesting. Or at least that's how it's supposed to work. Also, there
are defiantly SF stories, I think, that are more about the ideas and
"the world" rather than something about characters, or humanity, or
traditional literary ideas. William Gibson's work always feels this way
to me, for instance.

While I think I end up writing very character-based SF, and my tastes
tend much closer to the literary parts of the genre, my interest in
science fiction grows largely out of my love for the ideas of science
fiction, both as a reader and as a writer. Not because I like reading
about "cool stuff," though I do, but because I respect the way that the
idea gives rise to the more standard literary features.

Maybe this is part of what defines SF for me, and why I don't often
stray into fantasy. Also, to be clear, I don't think that Nancy Kress'
statement is particularly in conflict with mine: I find her stories to
excel at using conceptual material to generate powerful literary
stories. For whatever that means.

Onward and Upward!
