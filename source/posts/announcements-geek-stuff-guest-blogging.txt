I wrote an article for my friend `Melissa
Barton <http://melissabartonconsulting.blogspot.com/>`__ about `how to
use computers/technology more successfully and more
effectively <http://melissabartonconsulting.blogspot.com/2009/03/be-smarter-computer-user.html>`__,
and it went live over the weekend. I'm really happy with it, and it
represents all of the things I've been working through here, except
tuned for a more general audience. It's also under my given name (gasp!)
as if the tycho thing wasn't confusing enough as it is.

Emacs is great, and I'm a huge fan, but it's not for *everyone*, and for
those audences, thinking about what we learn from "advanced useage" and
then workind to apply that to more general use can be quite powerful.
This is a different take on the "how to attract general audences,"
process. I guess I'm mostly arguing that rather than make
software/hardware more "friendly," better to (also) educate users to be
more gruff?

In any case, that's up. I'm also posting an extra tychoish essay on
Wednesday because it didn't get posted (as I would have hoped) due to my
error a few weeks ago. Stay tuned for that. Also, maybe new Critical
Futures this week?

cheers, ty
