**Note:** *I tried to post this earlier today, but was thwarted by
something or other. I'm off to write one last entry today, which
you'll probably read in much quicker succession than I expected you
would anyway. Enjoy.*

So I'm making a mitten sweater. Which is to say that, I'm using a
`Latvian
Mitten <http://www.amazon.com/Latvian-Mittens-Traditional-Designs-Techniques/dp/0942018141>`__
Pattern for a sweater.

I'm doing a couple of things that are not particularly typical for me:

1. I'm using a sport weight merino yarn. Not only this, it's a generally
   available sport weight merino yarn. Made by Louet. I typically make
   stranded sweaters out of fingering weight yarn, and I typically use
   yarns that aren't particularly commonly available. Weaving yarns,
   mostly.

2. I'm knitting (most) of the sleeves before I start on the body. This
   is because I'm making an EPS-style sweater. That is, Elizabeth
   (Zimmerman's) Percentage System, and it's a nifty/brilliant way of
   making sweaters in one piece. The one I'm aiming for is the a saddle
   shouldered sweater. it's going to be (another) cardigan, and I think
   it'll be nifty.

   - I have the first sleeve done, and have about 4 inches done on the
     second sleeve. My goal is to get the second sleeve off of the
     double pointed needles before I start the body.

   - I'd say that about a quarter of my sweaters are EPS sweaters, but
     I almost always cheat and knit the sleeves from the shoulder down,
     by provisionally casting on the sleeve stitches, because I had an
     aversion to knitting sleeves, but I'm working on getting over it.

And it's fun knitting. I'll get pictures at some point.

In other knitting news, I'm sewing down the hem's on the morocco
sweater. I have the neck, the bottom, and most of one sleeve. I'm not in
a rush, and I have to remember to not judge this sweater until after the
wet block, because I fear that the sewing job looks a little sloppy, but
I think it's going to be fine in the end. So close.

Anyway, I'm off. I think I have enough writing to write about that I'll
have another post to day. Fathom that.

Onward and Upward!
