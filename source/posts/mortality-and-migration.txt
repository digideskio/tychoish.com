=======================
Mortality and Migration

I've been thinking that, while the articles I write for TA are great and
should continue to be a pillar of the site, shorter and more pithy posts
are also worthy content. Also, I do a crappy job of interacting with
other blog posts. So here's something I saw whilst plowing [1]_ through
my blog posts today: expect more.

`Things Change <http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=373>`__:

"As I was working out in the garden today, my first thought was that
as a society, we still havenâ€™t figured out how to manage the
intersection of mortality and migration."

(from `Easily Distracted <http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke>`__.)

I think this is an incredibly well put observation. The internet, and
aviation, make the world smaller in a lot of important ways, but it's
still a big place that most of us find difficult to move from place to
place. As a developmentalist-to-be this is right up my ally and I think
a quite interesting location for some interesting research some day.
Very quickly though, my next thought is of a few science fiction books
that deal with some of these issues. `Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars
Trilogy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy>`__, address the
migration issue (among other things), and Cory Doctrow's *`Eastern
Standard Tribe <http://www.craphound.com/est/>`__* looks at the effect
of the internet (and "world shrinking") on another "material reality:"
sleep. Interesting stuff.

Discuss!

Cheers, tycho

In fairness, I think my method of weblog reading as described by the
word "plow," might account for my lack of communication.
