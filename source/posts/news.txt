I heard back from *WesternState Flagship University* today.

No go.

Which is disheartening, mostly because I thought my chances were so good
to begin with.

On the up side, I wasn't particularly looking forward to being in
*WesternState* so perhaps this is a blessing in disguise. Though I was
really looking forward to the career possibilities that this program
provided. So, yeah, a little hurt and angry, as well, frankly.

I'm beginning to think about contingency plans--of which I don't have
anything particularly good--even though I still have two, technically
three, applications still outstanding. The two main ones are, pretty
much up in the air, which is sort of crazy.

Anyway, I have to program for a radio show that I'm doing this
afternoon, and I want to knit, and tonight is the my grandfather's
yahrzeit, which I think often makes this time in march more stressful
than it would otherwise be.

So, I'll be in touch. You be too.

Yours in struggle, *tycho*
