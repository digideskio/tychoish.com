Maple Morris Review

A few weekends ago, I went to very weird get together. The week before I
went to upstate New York to a festival that drew 5000 attendees. Then, I
went to Washington, DC to dance with 24 or 25 other people from across
the country and Canada. I think of it as "my generation," Morris dance
gathering.

This May marks my 10th anniversary of being a Morris dancer. I've spent
most of that time, easily being twenty years away from the next-youngest
Morris dancer on my team. Morris isn't aging quite *that* fast: but
there are a lot of quirky things that happen given the small sample
sizes.

I've been involved in the folk world for years. Lots of folk dance and
traditional music. I'm so accustomed to this, that I'm not really sure
what people who aren't do with their time. When I think about other
communities, I always reach back to experiences and phenomena that I've
seen in the folk world.

While I grew up in the folk dance world, I'm coming to terms with a
couple of things: First, folk communities are different in different
parts of the country/world, and the community in Boston (or New York, or
Philadelphia) is very different from what I grew up with. Second, I'm
realizing that while I'm "a young person" who grew up with music and
dance, I'm no longer "a folk dance kid," (and that's a nifty thing to
experience.)

Given this, I've had the following Morris related thoughts, that seem
worth recording:

-  It's really nice to be part of a single age cohort in this activity,
mostly because I've not had significant opportunity to dance with
people in my general age group.

-  I quite enjoy being more than just a familiar face in a contra dance
line, or someone that you see across the square when singing sacred
harp.

-  These weekends always challenge me to be a better dancer, and make me
realize that *I* need to focus and work on certain aspects of my
dancing.

-  While it's in-ideal to have gatherings capped at really small
numbers, having a small group means a greater strength of connection
between everyone, and it means that a few people can do the
organizing work without much institutional/organizational overhead.
That's really cool.

-  Once again, my motto is "you don't have to do everything." Which is
particularly difficult around Morris. But I think by avoiding
overdoing it I'm able to: avoid injury and have greater successes at
the things I do try. Can't argue with that. I'm young and I hope to
dance for many years to come, and there'll be time enough for
Sherborne then.
