the dark singularity

I read a pretty cool `interview with Vernor Vinge, in H+
magazine <http://hplusmagazine.com/articles/ai/singularity-101-vernor-vinge>`__,
where he talked about the coming technological singularity, which I
thought was really productive. I've read and participated in a lot
criticism of "Singularity Theory," where people make the argument that
the singularity is just a mystification on the process of normal
technological development, and that all this attention to the technology
distracts from "real" issues, and/or that singularity is too abstract,
too distant, and will only be recognizable in retrospect.

From reading Vinge's comments, I've come to several realizations:

-  Vinge's concept of the singularity is pretty narrow, and relates to
effect of creating human-grade information technology. Right now,
there are a lot of things that humans can do that machines *can't*,
The singularity then, is the point where that changes.

-  I liked how--and I find this to be the case with most "science
theory," but the scientists often have very narrow theories and the
popular press often forces a much more broad interpretation. I think
we get too caught up with thinking about the singularity as this cool
amazing thing that is the nerd version of "the second coming," and
forget that the singularity would really mark the end of society and
culture as we know it now. That it's a rather frightening
proposition.

-  Vinge's comparison of the singularity to the development of the
printing press is productive. He argues that the printing press was
conceivable before Gutenberg (they had books, the effects, however
were unimaginable, admittedly), in a way that the singularity isn't
conceivable to us given the current state of our lives and
technology. In a lot of ways, the technological developments required
in the Singularity, without attending to the social and cultural
facts. The singularity is really about the outsourcing of cognition
(writing, computers, etc.) rather than cramming more computing power
onto our microchips.

As i begin to understand this a bit better--as it's pretty difficult to
grok--I've begun to think about the singularity and post-singular
experience as being a much more dark possibility than had heretofore.
There are a lot of problems with "the human era," and I think
technology, particularly as humans interact with technology (eg. cyborg)
is pretty amazing. So why wouldn't the singularity be made of awesome?

Because it wouldn't be--to borrow an idea from William Gibson--evenly
distributed. The post-human era might begin with the advent of
singularity-grade intelligences, but there will be a lot of humans left
hanging around in the post-human age. Talk about class politics!

Secondly, the singularity represents the end of our society in a very
real sort of sense. Maybe literature, art, journalism, manufacturing,
farming, computer terminals and their operating systems (lending a whole
new meaning to the idea of a "dumb terminal"), and the Internet will
continue to be relevant in a post-human age. But probably not exactly.
While the means by which these activities and cultural pursuits might be
obsoleted (tweaking metabolisms, organic memory transfer, inboard
computer interfaces) are interesting, the death of culture is often a
difficult and trying process, particularly for the people (like
academics, educators, writers, artists, etc.) "Unintelligible" is sort
of hard to grasp.

And I think frightening as a result. Perhaps that's the largest lesson
that I got from Vinge's responses: the singularity is on many levels
something to be feared: that when you think about the singularity the
response should be on some visceral level "I'd really like to avoid
that," rather than, "Wouldn't it be cool if this happened."

And somehow that's pretty refreshing. At least for me.
