Because I spent so long out of human form in work crazed demon type form
I've changed, understandably.

Just now I was running through what I had to do this weekend. Here's my
list:

Read 100 pages for a history. Write an English Paper. Write a
scholorship essay or two Read a Zora Neal Hurston story for my
African american lit class Write two 250 word, reader response
entries for my english class Write a presentation in spanish

And you know what my response was?

Wow. Easyness. That's nothing!

As one of my friends said, after realizing that even if college really
is harder, which given the rigors of European (IB) standards we kind of
doubt, We'll only have five classes.... "Damn college is going to be
borrrring." And frankly. I concur. (We both have eight currently)

Cheers!
