Aeron Woes

I have an Aeron chair at my desk at home. Confession.

I got it in April when I moved to New York City. The only piece of
furniture that I had that I couldn't move in my (now former) car was my
desk chair. I found a good deal on an Aeron chair and I rationalized to
myself that the cost of the chair was actually about the cost of movers.
Savings right?

It also helped, that I was leaving a job where I had an Aeron chair in
my office, and I knew that in the short term I would be working from
home. While my old desk chair was (and is) quite nice, *it's not quite
the same*. Sit in an Aeron chair for a couple of two years, and it's
hard to go back. I've sat in other chairs since then, and it's never
quite the same.

Having said that, after a cleaning incident today, I would like to
collect a few gripes about the Aeron chair for your consideration.

-  The assembly right beneath the chair collects dust and dirt in a
proportion that doesn't seem quite possible. It's clearly an artifact
of the mesh, and likely a commentary on the air circulation of my
apartment.

Regardless, dusting nightmare.

-  The arms scuff and scratch on desks, if the bottom of the desk isn't
completely smooth. This isn't an actual problem: the chair still
works fine and is as comfortable as ever, but it's a annoying.

I've never looked at the underside of a desk before seriously. With
every other chair I've either ordered a variant sans arms, or I've take
then arms off as soon as possible.

The Aeron arms are low enough that they've never bothered me, so I
thought "might as well." But it's still annoying.

That's all.
