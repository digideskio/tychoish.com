So, `Christina <http://vorare.wordpress.com>`__, wrote a comment (thanks
christina!) regarding my little tirade on
`NaNoWriMo <http://tychoish.com/posts/no-na-no-wri-mo/>`__, that
basically said, the project might allow (if I'm reading this right) for
non or new writers to get a more clear understanding about what "being a
writer" is, and maybe make it more accessible. But you can read the
comment in more depth
`here <http://tychoish.com/2007/11/no-na-no-wri-mo/>`__.

I replied (as I do try to do to many comments), and when I was done I
found that I had basically written another blog post on the subject, and
I think it moves the conversation around, so I'm going to post it. I'm
interested in what you all think, though I suspect that the NaNo-ers are
deep in trenched in their novels, and the remainder probably don't care
all that much. Anyway, here's my little response:

I really don't have anything against NaNo, and think it's a goods
project. For many years now, I've been the leader of a small science
fiction writers list on yahoogroups, and there's a way in which
these folks who very much want to be writers, are sometimes afraid
of plowing through a novel, so having a project like NaNo makes a
lot of sense, and can sort of light the right kind of fire under
peoples asses. So it's a great project for people who already write
a lot, who haven't made the jump to novel writing, but maybe have
always wanted to.

In this respect, I think the NaSweKniMo (national sweater knitting
month, which is the brain child of Shannon. Okey (I think), is a
great project in the best sprit of NaNoWriMo. then again, I think
sweater knitting leaves you less prone for burnout than novel
writing, but maybe that's just me.

And maybe this is the price of success for NaNoWriMo, but in the
past couple of years, there are people who do NaNo because it's some
cool social bonding ritual. There are write-ins, there are support
groups, and it's all focused on the word count. Which really so not
what writing is about, at least to me. Writing is so often a
solitary practice that means neglected social ties, nights of
insomnia when you can't get a story out of your mind, haggard pushes
to deadlines, and a lot of time sitting around having arguments with
yourself while scribing unintelligible notes on things that weren't
meant to be written on.

I think that while this invokes a nativist-type epistemology that
I'm not entirely comfortable with, it's true: writers write, not
because they want to, but because they can't not write. I took
several years off of fiction writing (the past four, or so,) but in
that time managed to amass 200,000 words of writing for my blog,
plus tons of stuff for classes, and I'm a better writer for it, so I
think that still counts.

Anyway, there you have it...

Onward and Upward!
