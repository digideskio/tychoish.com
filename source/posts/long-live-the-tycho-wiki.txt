Long Live the Tycho Wiki

I realized that I made a *lot* of changes to the way my websites were
arranged and worked recently, and I thought that it would be good to
write a few about the hottest new thing, and my rationale for messing
everything up. *Again.*

Basically, I took the CriticalFutures.com site, and turned it into the
posts section here, moving a bunch of content *back* to
`tychoish.com <http://tychoish.com/>`__ that used to be here. This time,
everything is powered by `ikiwiki <http://ikiwiki.info/>`__, and while I
callously dropped all comments [1]_, I think the move is one of general
and overall improvement.

At the same time, I think there are challenges. Rather than comment
pages, there's now a "*discourse" link at the top left of the pages,
which lets you sign in and create a new page for discussion related to
the page you're currently viewing. I liked the name "discourse" rather
than "discussion," but I fear there may be some confusion. I can change
it over back without much issue, if any one feels
strongly.

Mostly, it's still the same blog that it's always been, and I'm having
fun with it. The essay/rhizome divide may turn out to be tenuous in the
long term, and it might disappear, but for now it makes sense. I've not
been doing *as many* wiki-based things, though I have worked on a
queer theories page, and the technical writing section is
something that I'm pleased with. Wikis are much more difficult to use
and produce than one would initially guess. The concept is simple, the
software is simple, and the work is remarkably time consuming and
difficult to do right. And then there's the problem of contributors.

I don't know how it's going to sort out, but I look forward to
hearing from you, and making *stuff* on this domain.

.. [1] Which totally sucks, but I had already given into using disqus, the
   migration would be really difficult, and the truth be told, I'd much
   rather participate in discussions that involved the creation of new
   wiki pages, and that involved invitations to email lists, and direct
   emails contact over IRC or IM. Maybe this is more fragmented, and
   maybe I'm shooting nascent conversation in the foot before it has a
   chance to get off the ground, but I think "conversation at any cost,"
   is not the best model for a community.
