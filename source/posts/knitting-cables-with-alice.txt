Knitting Cables With Alice
==========================

I'm knitting again!

I seem to do these posts every now and then. In any case, one of my
mom's friends from knitting camp came for a post-thanksgiving visit, and
really kick started my winter knitting projects. I'd been lagging on
some older projects for far too long, and having an excuse to sit around
and knit was a really good thing. I got to the end of the first sleeve
avove the cuff of the latvian dreaming sweater, and started a new
sweater. That new sweater is what I'm here to talk about today. I'll
cover the other knitting progress in the coming weeks.

So I, uh, started a new sweater. With cables.

I should point out here that I've never made a cabled sweater before.
Rather than design something simple, I flipped through some knitting
patterns, and chose of all things, "Irish Moss" from Alice Starmore's
*Aran Knitting.*

For those non-knitters out there, this is a pretty rare book, long out
of print and very highly valued. The designs, though a bit dated, are
very easy to adapt into classic masterpieces, and they're not exactly
"entry level sweaters."

Typical.

I've knit several Starmores before, but thusfar I've only done colorwork
sweaters from her.

I also changed a few things about this sweater.

Also typical.

My modifications, I think are pretty straightforward, but none the less
significant. They are:

- I'm knitting it in the round when the pattern called for a sweater
  knit in pieces.
- I omitted the ribbing, as the entire sweater is knit in a twisted
  stitch-ribbing (with cables) basically. So the ribbing was only
  decorative, and I like the way it looks when cable patterns start at
  the very bottom edge of the sweater.
- I've decided to knock off most of the filer stitches at the sides of
  the sweater, because I'm going for a 38-40 inch sweater not a 42-46
  inch sweater. I think knocking off 18 stitches from the front and
  back was a little much (which is what I did at the bottom edge.) but
  I think a sweater with a little bit of tapering will be a good thing,
  so I'll begin to increase after I have 2 inches completed, once I
  have a good idea of *actual* gage.
- I'm going to slit the neck open, and set in the sleeve to *about*
  shoulder width, but that depends on how many stitches I increase on
  the sides, and how the pattern looks. If I don't increase enough to
  make it work, I'll just make a gusset.
- I'll slit the neck open to mid-chest, as I do on most of my sweaters
  so that the crew neck isn't as restricting. The pattern seems like it
  will support this.
- I'll knit the sleeves and saddles from the shoulder/collar down. That
  always seems to work well. Again, that's in a while.

And so forth. I'm semi-weened from the cable needle, but I keep it
around just in case.

And that's about it. Unless you want the technical specs.

**Yarn**: Schoolhouse Press Quebecois

**Needles**: Addi Lace 3.0mm (US Size 2/2.5)

**Color**: Grey

**Gauge:** About 6 stitches to the inch in St. St. Or something close, I
didn't check closely, but it looks to be about right. There are ~238
stitches at the moment, so that seems to be about right given
everything.

Ok that's it, for real. More later. I might actually take pictures of
this one. Imagine that.
