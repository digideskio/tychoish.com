=============================
Observations of a New Student
=============================

I'm cross posting this to the livejournal so that former classmates can
read it.

I'm starting classes today at the school I never really considered for
undergrad, so I don't have to pay student loans, so I can work on
academic projects, and so I can stay in the mindset as I apply (again)
to graduate school next year. That and there are classes here that my
alma mater could never run, because of staffing and other demands on the
faculty.

It's also a very different kind of institution. Here are some of my
observations:

1. Cars? What? The campus has a number of much higher trafficked roads
than I'm used to on a campus. It also has stoplights. I approached a
light, it said "don't walk" cars weren't coming, so I trotted across
the road, passing two students who were standing there waiting for
the light to change. I laughed to myself.

2. Male students all look like TKEs at Beloit, thus far. Must remember
to not hold it against them. What happened to college student chic? I
sense a distinct deficit of students wearing pajamas.

3. Fewer smokers? Or maybe it's just raining. Or maybe all my old
friends smoked.
