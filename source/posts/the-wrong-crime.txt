This might be unpopular at the moment, but....

Regarding the Larry Craig thing... (because what self respecting queer
doesn't have an opinion on the subject?).

He's an asshole, but then he's a senator, so that's not much of a
surprise. If you want to put the fucker in jail, then by god do it for
something important, not for *trying* to have sex in a bathroom, which
when you think about it, is a really stupid thing to put something as
dumb and as trivial as that. Really, frankly, dare I say it's almost
borderline homophobic?

That's all I have to say. For more reading:
