I did some blog writing for the upcoming week today. It was good, I
managed to pull off nearly two weeks the last time I sat down and
seriously wrote for the blog, so I haven't had the chance to really sort
through thoughts like this in a long time. It's amazing how much writing
blog posts provides me the space to work through things that I'm
thinking about. It's also amazing to me how much I've grown to depend
and expect this space as part of my life, and how scattered my thinking
is without this blog. It'll be interesting in *another* ten years to see
how this changes. In any case the real point of this little post is to
say that I ran a word count of my efforts today and came up with a total
around 3,800 words (turns out, this weeks is a light week). I remember
in high school and college thinking that this was a lot of words. And it
is, and indeed it's easier to write things conversationally for the blog
than it is to write logically structured essays or fiction. But still.
Evidence, I'm convinced that writing effectively is more about
establishing habits rather than anything mystical.
