I just signed up for a new ruby-on-rails based tumble log service that
produced the following error message:

Your browser does not support javascript and we were too lazy to
support browsers that do not support javascript

The ironic thing, is that my browser, does support java script. It's
basically firefox written in cocoa and nice. So rather than test a
script, they checked to see if it was firefox and then borked when it
wasn't. Lame.

Besides, who needs new fangled things like that when you have wordpress
and all it's goodness. (ie. this site.)

Speaking of Rails, I'm totally going to use the ruby instiki project
next time I need a wiki....
