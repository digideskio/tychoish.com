`Joey Hess' blog of his work on
git-annex-assitant <http://git-annex.branchable.com/design/assistant/blog/>`__
has been a great inspiration to me. Basically, Joey had a very
successful Kickstarter campaign to fund his work on a very cool tool of
his that he wants to expand to be a kind of drop-box replacement. As
part of the project, he's been blogging nearly every day about the work,
his progress, and the problems he's faced.

I really admire this kind of note taking, and think it's really
interesting to see how people progress on cool projects. More than that,
I think it's a cool way to make yourself accountable to the world, and
help ensure things get done.

By the same token, when your project work is writing, increasing daily
workload by writing notes/posts rather than actually doing work is a
problem, on the other hand, given the right kind of templates, and a
good end of day habit, it might be easy and a good habit.

Anyone else interested in this? Thoughts on using rhizome versus
some other area of `tychoish.com <http://tychoish.com/>`__? So many
choices!
