Mission Statements

We've been working on having some sort of mission statement as a way of
demarcating and outlining our purpose as a way of giving us structure to
work from.

So first off, we have Heather's original mission statment from a few
months back. (which yes, I did have to dig through months and months of
lj archives.)

We’re going to be looking at feminist poetry, how it has evolved
alongside post modern studies of identity, and how that in turn
complicates its usefulness as activism. It’s also going to touch on
the presence of radical lesbian feminist poets as theorists in the
‘second wave’ and their comparative absence in 'third wave’ feminism
/ queer theory. What does it mean that our poets are no longer some
of the dominant theorists? How does that impact theory / our
identity as a movement? etc. We’ll probably have to narrow the scope
of this project when it comes time to write our paper /
(symposium?), but this is where we’re begining.

Now we have a more refined one that we've been working on this very
morning.... (Mostly of Heather's Creation) > This special project will
examine selections of lesbian-feminist poetry from the ‘second wave’ to
the ‘third wave’ / era of queer theory. We will examine how
lesbian-feminist/ queer poetry has evolved (or in some cases, refused to
evolve) alongside postmodern theories of identity, and how that in turn
complicates its relationship to activism. What does it mean when our
poets are no longer some of our dominant theorists? How does that impact
theory / our identity as a movement?

Finally I took a hack it, and got this: > The rising popularity of
postmodern identity theories within the feminist/queer movement,
primarily in the academy, has had a profound impact on the ways in which
poets align their work with identity categories. In that direction we
are interested the deveoplment of "queerness" as a category in tension
with iconic kind of lesbian-feminist. These questions force us to
examine how feminist and queer oriented identity poetry has moved out of
the academy, and ways that identity alignment is both reject and remains
a driving framework for feminist and queer theory and poetry.

Then Heather (who came in to my room to use my long mirror, but I'll
pretend it was for the discussion) was like "great, but you know being
historically prescriptive without actually researching it, isn't really
A GoodThing(tm), and I thought she had a really good point, so I'm going
to change it some more: > The rising popularity of postmodern identity
theories within the feminist/queer movement, primarily in the academy,
has had a profound impact on the ways in which poets align their work
with identity categories. In that direction we are interested in
determining if the deveoplment of "queerness" as a category is actually
in tension with the lesbian-feminist poet/theorist who has reached a
semi iconic status within feminist and queer 'political' movements.
Specifically, we seek to unpack the disavowal of identity alignment in
contemporary poetry, complicate its rejection and see if and how
identity alignment remains a driving framework for contemporary feminist
and queer theory and poetry.

Now admittedly, I'm still a bit proscriptive here, but leave it too
open, means it's hard to get a good structure, and I think generally we
know what's going on, right now we need to having something to work
with; it can always change later
