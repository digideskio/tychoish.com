I put on a sweater that I designed a few years ago, and finally finished
last year, with the Louet Merino (Gems/Opal) Sport Weight. Here's the
picture I posted to ravelry:

and here's a picture of the detail:

It's a *great* sweater to wear. It's warm, it's soft, it fits great.
When I made it, I was expecting that the darker color would be
prominent, I frankly don't know what I was on at all. I'm going to blame
it on the fact that my roommate had gotten a puppy and I was taking 24
credit hours that semester. The fact that it fits so well is frankly
amazing, given all that.

The center pattern is "rams horn," from a Meg Swansen book, the next
pattern is a medallion pattern from the *Traditional Fair Isle Knitting*
book, the next two patterns are from the *Traditional Scandinavian
Knitting* book, and finally, the edge pattern is from the perrie pattern
for Meg Swansen's Fair Isle cardigan. I still don't know exactly what I
was thinking.

The store I'm working at carries this yarn, and I'm thinking that I
might have to knit something with it. So much for all that talk about
creative constraints, I think I'm going to be slipping.
