Buildcloth v0.3 Planning
========================

I spent a lot of time at the end of the summer working on finishing out
the basic
`buildcloth <http://cyborginstitute.org/projects/buildcloth/>`__
functionality, and haven't really gotten the chance to use it properly.
There were some flaws:

-  a dumb oversight means that the hash-based dependency checking
doesn't work.

-  Buildcloth is a bit complicated and designed for a general purpose.
In practical terms, I made buildcloth to perform a task that I've
been able to accomplish with 10% or less of the code.

-  There's no good separation between "the management of a build system"
and "the build system data" in the system as it currently exists.

Buildcloth is a nifty idea, and one that I'd like to expand upon. Also
since the project is still pre-1.0, it seems reasonable to take these
lessons and work on building a more usable implementation.

This post is a collection of thoughts on what I'd like to accomplish for
0.3:

-  pull out the job queue/running system from the build data
organization.

-  collect more state in the dependency checking system/infrastructure.

-  separate data ingestion from build system organization.

-  remove ingestion and processing logic from the command line tool.

-  impose sub-module structure to make the interfaces for all of the
different aspects of the program.

No clue about time frame. Feel free (and encouraged) to leave comments
if you're interested in helping or have a feature that you'd really like
to see.

Onward and Upward!
