So this is totally a "just for fun" post. As you might have noticed from
all the blogging I've done about rearranging computers, switching to
Linux and getting a new phone, the second half of 2008 has had a lot of
computer acquisitions and changes. I try to thematically name
computers/partitions and hard drives, and I've been through a couple of
naming schemes, but I have a new one that I kind of like: Great names in
western philosophy.

Now technically, the best name schemes for networked computers are
groups of related nouns. So in a big network, you'd have printers named
after flowers (violet, daisy, petunia) and laptops named after sheep
(merino, finn, coopworth, jacob) and desktops named after crops (corn,
wheat, soybean, tobacco) say. Actually these are pretty bad choices, but
choosing common, inoffensive, and generic nouns is probably idea. This
way, if you're browsing a network you can tell what things are pretty
quickly, and you won't run out of names and have to have more than one
system.

So knowing that drawing every name from the same pool is probably the
wrong thing to do, here's the list of my little collection.

-  Leibniz: the desktop
-  Spinoza: cellphone/blackberry
-  Hegel: the ThinkPad
-  Levi-Strauss: the wireless access point.
-  Deleuze: the linux partition of the macbook
-  Guatteri: the OS X partition of the macbook

My knowledge of modern and 19th century philosophy is way more limited
and touch and go than my knowledge of 20th century. You could of course
make the argument that Levi-Strauss was more of an anthropologist than a
philosopher, but I tend to cast a pretty big net, and think that
Clifford Gertz would even qualify for the list too. I suppose that I
could have made had laptops be German philosophers, and desktop be
French philosophers; or I could have divided it up by centuries. Anyway,
it's fun, and here's a list of possible names for future gear:

-  Gertz
-  Derrida
-  Spivak
-  Marx/Engels
-  Ricoeur
-  Foucault
-  Kierkegaard

You'll notice that I didn't include Nietzsche on the list. I think it's
poor planning to name a computer (or anything) after someone whose known
for being crazy. I include Foucault out of personal fondness, but have
avoided other neo-Marxists, though I suppose that would open things up
to Gramsci and Althusser (if he hadn't gone crazy) or Merleau-Ponty (but
I never spell that one right on the first go).

Other suggestions of favorite philosophers are of course welcome.

Do you have a naming scheme? If so, what is it?
