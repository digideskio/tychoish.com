The Joy of Cats

In the first class meeting of my first class today, I was charged with
the task of introducing myself (name/class/major(s)) and the answer to
the following question: "If you could be any animal, what would it be
and why."

I was fretting my turn, because I wanted to say something weird, but I
was feeling incredibly uninspired at 9:00 am. It came my turn and I just
said "cat."

But there was an expectation of an explanation. Oh crap.

"Because they're cranky." I said, followed by a short but awkward pause.
Everyone laughed nervously.

"I mean they're fuzzy and cute, but they have edge. Lots of edge, I like
edge. Cute's good too," I amended. There was a bit of a chuckle around
and by now my turn was over and I moved on.

I love having cats. Minaloush is incredibly cute, but also edgy as hell.
She likes to sleep with me, but she also is very particular about how
this occurs and where next to me she sleeps. It's crucial that one
sleeps under substantial blankets when sleeping with the 'loushis
because if she decides that you've wronged her by rolling over, your leg
could become forfeit.

The other thing is there's this place in the middle of her back that if
you scratch a lot, she does this "chin lift" and her eyes close and she
smiles, and it's potentially the most adorable thing in the history of
the world.

That is all. More 'loushisness in the future.
