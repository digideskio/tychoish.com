So I've been incredibly angsty about the whole graduate school
application process this time around, no real surprise. Ironically, I
was pretty confident about my chances last time, and here I am now. I'm
doing better about this. First, I took another practice GRE and got
solid, but not stellar scores, scores that would be good enough for my
purposes. That is, they wouldn't preclude acceptance anywhere, and would
probably fall safely within the "typical" range.

Secondly, and more importantly, a professor that I'm interested in
studying with--where I had previously expected to be this year--has
asked to have a telephone discussion tomorrow (Wednesday) morning. This
is a good thing, I think I tend to do well in person/on the phone, and
even though there was a snafu last year, if this could come through in a
real way... Good things folks. Good things.

I'm moving forward on a lot of the things that I've been dragging my
feet on for a while, and while I'm still worried, I'm feeling better.
God knows why.

Also I'm reading an utterly crappy book on aging and sexuality. It's
written by a journalist, which accounts for the poor methodology and
virtually unvarying sentence structure. Although she does talk about
aging "gay men and lesbians," I think she doesn't understand enough
about *ahem* youthful queer sexuality to be able to approach queer sex
as we age. Also, there's more unironic quoting of Andrew Sullivan (sorry
no linking for the bastard) than I can really stomach.

Anyway, normal day at the yarn store, I hope you all have a good day!
