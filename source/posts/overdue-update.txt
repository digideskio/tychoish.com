Overdue Update

I went through a few days ago to collect all of the updates and work
that I'd done since the :doc:`last time I did one of these posts </posts/update-rhythm>`. 
Sometimes just looking through an activity log is all you need to
remember that you're actually doing something. Here's what I've been
working on:

- **isd**" is a developing page of material for my
  ongoing :doc:`story project </critical-futures>`. I've written it in my
  ":doc:`Wiki Fiction </posts/wiki-fiction>`" post. This particular page
  is basically sysadminning-punk, if I may be so bold. The story as a
  whole is largely a future history of human's expansion into the solar
  system and beyond, using Kim Stanley Robinson's idea of
  *Accelerando*. This piece in particular is all about the emergence of
  an asynchronous database network that eventually replaces the
  Internet as we know it, because interstellar distances render
  trans-planetary TCP (in any form) unworkable. I've got an outline and
  I'm slowly working to fill in the blanks. Editing, ideas, and any
  amount of text are all welcome.

- I added a page to the technical writing section on ":doc:`Why the Documentation Sucks </technical-writing/documentation-sucks>`," and
  I've done some additional editing and revising of this section of the
  wiki. The :doc:`/technical-writing/documentation-sucks` page has also
  served as the foundation of my post about
  :doc:`documentation publishing systems </posts/publishing-system-requirements>`.

- I've added a number of new posts that I hope won't be forgotten too
  quickly. They are:

  - :doc:`Is Android the Future of Linux </posts/is-android-the-future-of-linux>`

  - :doc:`Advice for Blogging Successfully </posts/advice-for-blogging-successfully>`

  - :doc:`:Issue Tracking and the Health of Open Source Software </posts/issue-tracking-and-the-health-of-open-source-software>`

  - :doc:`Tablet Interfaces and Intuition </posts/tablet-interfaces-and-intuition>`

  - :doc:`Org Mode and Mobile Writing </posts/org-mode-and-mobile-writing>`

  - :doc:`Publishing System Requirements </posts/publishing-system-requirements>`

  - :doc:`Android Tablets and the Workstations of the Future </posts/android-tablets-and-the-workstations-of-the-future>`

- There has also been some discussions of new and old rhizomes on the
  discourse pages.

- A few weeks ago I posted a few new scripts in the code section.
  Tell me what you think:

  - :doc:`/code/ikiwiki-tasklist`

  - :doc:`/code/download-mail`

- My post, :doc:`9 Awesome SSH Tricks </posts/9-awesome-ssh-tricks>` from
  March 2011, spent a number of hours on the front page of hacker new.
  You can read `the comments over
  there <http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3011947>`__, and probably
  on some other sites as well.

The coolest part about this is that some of you have helped to build a
page of :doc:`/posts/ssh-tricks` on the wiki that go above and beyond the little
tricks that I use.

And finally,I 'd like to welcome Kevin Grande, who made a new
*folk* page recently. I'm also very sorry that I haven't been updating
more frequently. I started a new job on September 26, and between that
and my usual gallivanting around for singing and dancing my blogging
habit has. One the other hand I'm writing about 1200 words a day, and
life is pretty good so no complaints there.

Onward and Upward!
