Overdue Update

I went through a few days ago to collect all of the updates and work
that I'd done since the [[last time I did one of these
posts\|rhizome/update-rhythm]]. Sometimes just looking through an
activity log is all you need to remember that you're actually doing
something. Here's what I've been working on:

- **[[critical-futures/isd]]**" is a developing page of material for my
  ongoing [[story project\|critical-futures]]. I've written it in my
  "[[Wiki Fiction\|rhizome/wiki-fiction]]" post. This particular page
  is basically sysadminning-punk, if I may be so bold. The story as a
  whole is largely a future history of human's expansion into the solar
  system and beyond, using Kim Stanley Robinson's idea of
  *Accelerando*. This piece in particular is all about the emergence of
  an asynchronous database network that eventually replaces the
  Internet as we know it, because interstellar distances render
  trans-planetary TCP (in any form) unworkable. I've got an outline and
  I'm slowly working to fill in the blanks. Editing, ideas, and any
  amount of text are all welcome.

- I added a page to the [[technical-writing]] section on "[[Why the
  Documentation Sucks\|technical-writing/documentation-sucks]]," and
  I've done some additional editing and revising of this section of the
  wiki. The [[technical-writing/documentation-sucks]] page has also
  served as the foundation of my post about [[documentation publishing
  systems\|rhizome/publishing-system-requirements]].

- I've added a number of new posts that I hope won't be forgotten too
  quickly. They are:

  - [[Is Android the Future of Linux\|rhizome/is-android-the-future-of-linux]]

  - [[Advice for Blogging Successfully\|rhizome/advice-for-blogging-successfully]]

  - [[Issue Tracking and the Health of Open Source
    Software\|rhizome/issue-tracking-and-the-health-of-open-source-software]]

  - [[Tablet Interfaces and Intuition\|rhizome/tablet-interfaces-and-intuition]]

  - [[Org Mode and Mobile Writing\|rhizome/org-mode-and-mobile-writing]]

  - [[Publishing System Requirements\|rhizome/publishing-system-requirements]]

  - [[Android Tablets and the Workstations of the Future\|rhizome/android-tablets-and-the-workstations-of-the-future]]

- There has also been some discussions of new and old rhizomes on the
  discourse pages. These are:

  - [[Discussion of Android and the Future of
    Linux\|rhizome/is-android-the-future-of-linux/discourse]]

  - [[Git Mail Discussion\|rhizome/git-mail/discourse]]

  - [[Tablet Discussion\|rhizome/and-then-i-broke-down-and-got-a-tablet/discourse]]

  - [[Create Better Task
    Items\|rhizome/create-better-task-items/discourse]]

  - [[Writing Software Requiremens
    Discussions\|rhizome/writing-software-beyond-emacs/discourse]]

- A few weeks ago I posted a few new scripts in the [[code]] section.
  Tell me what you think:

  - [[code/ikiwiki-tasklist]]

  - [[code/download-mail]]

- My post, [[9 Awesome SSH Tricks\|rhizome/9-awesome-ssh-tricks]] from
  March 2011, spent a number of hours on the front page of hacker new.
  You can read `the comments over
  there <http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3011947>`__, and probably
  on some other sites as well.

The coolest part about this is that some of you have helped to build a
page of [[ssh-tricks]] on the wiki that go above and beyond the little
tricks that I use.

And finally,I 'd like to welcome [[folk/kevingranade]], who made a new
[[folk]] page recently. I'm also very sorry that I haven't been updating
more frequently. I started a new job on September 26, and between that
and my usual gallivanting around for singing and dancing my blogging
habit has. One the other hand I'm writing about 1200 words a day, and
life is pretty good so no complaints there.

Onward and Upward!
