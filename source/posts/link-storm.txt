Link Storm

I have a bunch of links that have been hanging around *too long*, that
I'd like to share with you, so here they are. Enjoy!

- `Distrust Simplicity <http://distrustsimplicity.net/>`__ is a great
  short form blog, that I'm really liking.

- The `Singularity Summit <http://www.singularitysummit.com/>`__ is a
  cyborg/futurist event that a reader wrote me a note about *a rather
  long time ago*. If you're interested in the singularity and issues
  and ideas related to that.

- `Hypo <http://github.com/dto/hypo>`__ a literate programing (with
  org-babel) based asset management system for game development. (`hypo
  example <http://github.com/dto/hypo/raw/master/hypo.org>`__.

- `Common Lisp Support in
  Org-Babel <http://github.com/dto/org-babel-lisp/blob/master/org-babel-lisp.el>`__.
  I feel like there's probably a joke here.

- `Mango.io <http://mango.io/about/>`__ a markdown-based CMS, using
  Python tools. I'm not sure if it's the kind of thing that I'm likely
  to ever want to use *myself* but it's an idea.

- `A New York Times Article about Podcasting and Leo Laporte's TWiT
  Network <http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/27/technology/27podcast.html>`__
  While the content of this article is interesting in it's own right,
  there are a couple of "bigger" picture things happening. First, the
  old media (i.e. "the Times") covering the new media (i.e. "TWiT,") is
  always interesting. Secondly, and less obviously, it's interesting
  how the biggest successes in the "New Media," are by veterans of the
  "Old Media," (like Laporte, who had a career in Radio and television
  before doing TWiT.)

- `Social Text Journal: The Dramatic Face of
  Wikileaks <http://www.socialtextjournal.org/blog/2010/12/the-dramatic-face-of-wikileaks.php>`__,
  is a meta-meta-meta look at wikileaks and the "new media" moment that
  it represents.
