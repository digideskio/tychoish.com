Fan Fiction is Criticism

I must confess that I'm mostly uninvolved in the world of fan fiction
these days, though I have traveled in "fanish" circles at various points
in my past. It's not because I don't think fans have interesting things
to say about literature and media, or that I don't think what's
happening in fandom important and fascinating. No, I'm mostly withdrawn
because I have too much on my plate and participating in fandom doesn't
really contribute to the specific goals I have at this moment. But I
sometimes feel that way about social science.

In any case, I'd like to put forth the following arguments for viewing
fan fiction as a form a literary criticism rather than a literary
attempt in it's own right:

- Fan fiction is a form of literary criticism. Sure it's casual, sure
it's written in the forum of a story, but the fan fictioner and the
critic both write from the same core interest in interpreting texts
and using varying readings of texts to create larger understandings
of our world.

- The fact that fan fiction looks like a story, is mostly distracting
to what's happening in these texts. Fan fiction, has always been
written in communities. The people who read fan fiction are largely
the people who write fan fiction. Fan fiction inspires

- The quality of fan fiction is also largely irrelevant to the point of
whether fan fiction is worthwhile. More so than other forms of
writing, fan fiction is less about the technical merits of the text,
and more about the discursive process under which the texts are
created. Better quality writing makes better fan fiction, certainly
but I don't think fan fiction *centers* on those kinds of values.

- Copyright, and the "intellectual property" status of fan fiction is
also sort of moot. It's true that if we're being honest fan fiction
impinges upon the copyright of the original author. At the same time,
fan fiction doesn't really hurt creators: people aren't confused that
fan fiction is "real fiction," fan fiction by and large doesn't
divert sales from "real fiction," and so forth. Sure, it's a bit
weird for some others to find other people playing in their sand
boxes, but the truth is that authors have never had a great deal of
control over what happens to their work post-publication, so it's
fair.

Additionally, I think that fan fiction accomplishes something that are
incredibly powerful and worthwhile that "normal" fiction cannot
accomplish. Writing fan fiction can be, I'd wager, an incredibly
effective educational experience for new writers, particularly genre
fiction writers. By providing a very fast feedback loop with an audience
of readers and writers (and lovers of literature and story telling.) Not
to mention the fact that because fan fiction tends to be somewhat
ephemeral and there's a wealth of inspiration and impetus for fiction,
fan writers can write *a lot*, and if they choose in a very productive
sort of way.

And that is almost certainly a good thing.
