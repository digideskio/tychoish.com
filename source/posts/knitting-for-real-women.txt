========================
Knitting for "Real Women
========================

So there's this book of knitting patterns called "classic knits for real
women"

I am naturally hesitant to get behind a book that's presupposes some
notion of "real womanhood," right? but this book has middle aged women
on the cover which bodes well (white, admittedly, though it's a British
publication from a pretty rurally located company). [1]_

And the designs look to be simple, non-fashion designs, with a
traditional edge, with good yarn, and what not: I think they're using
"real" in contrast to "couture fashion model," which is a heart warming
development.

On the one hand, the language kind of sucks, and on the other, I'm
thinking *rock on* sweaters that people can wear.

Thoughts?

.. [1] So it's a global world, and there's no excuse, but the company is
   HQ'd in Holmfirth or some such, in the north of England, So I'm prone
   to give them a little more leeway than I would otherwise.
