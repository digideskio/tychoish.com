I did a computer restart a few days ago [1]_, and never reopened
NetNewsWire. This means that I haven't been reading blogs for a few
days: pathetically, this doesn't mean that I'm any more behind than I
typically am, alas. As a consequence I don't have as many funny things
to post for you.

Having said that, to restart, I wanted to be able to close bunches of
tabs and have a record of where I was. I think I was offline at the time
of the restart. So I made a text file and copy and pasted the urls.
Given that I have nothing else to post, here it is. After all,
`tychoish <http://tychoish.com/>`__ is my notebook. Right?

Enjoy!

It's funny that this is such a noteworthy sort of event. I routinely
stay up for 3-4 weeks, sometimes more I think.
