The astute among you will notice that the "Blogging" category of TealArt
has been moved under the "everyone has a story," (the dandy new
Narrative Studies section of TealArt, on the premise that blogs, at
least as Chris and I are likely to write about them, are a narrative
device, and should be included this discussion.

As I was writing a post about this blog, I noticed that the author
referred to "web blogs," which is testament to the fact that blog is
indeed a word in it's own right, but is in fact a combination of words
which should never occur. Weblogs are logs, journals, which are made
special/unique by a) the fact that they exist *online* and more
technically, b) the software used to maintain them (this is a defining
feature, and that's why I feel it's relevant to talk about WordPress
upgrades on this site.)

Just saying!
