It's been a while since I've written one of these "clip posts," but
there's no time like the present to get started with that. I hope
everyone out there in internet-land is having a good end of the year.
I'll try and get a retrospective/new years out in the next few days, and
avoid belaboring the point here.

As I said :doc:`last friday </rhizome/longer-forms>` it's my intent to focus
here on shorter/quicker thoughts, and focus my free writing/project time
for work on longer projects (fiction, non-fiction, perhaps some
programming.) So far so good.
