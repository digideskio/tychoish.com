==================================
getting emacs daemon to work right
==================================

In the latest/forthcoming version of `GNU
Emacs <http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`__ there exists a daemon
mode. The intent is to make it easier to run in one instance of emacs,
and rather than starting new instances, you can run everything in one
instance. Less overhead on your system, and everyone's happy. Without
daemon mode, you can still run in server mode and get *nearly* the same
effect, but you end up with one emacs frame that's the "host," which
means, if you're dumb and close it (or it's running inside of another
process which crashes...) all of the frames close.

I suppose, as an interjection, that my attempt to explain why this is
cool to a generalized audience is somewhat of a lost cause.

In any case, there's a problem daemon mode doesn't behave like anyone
would want it to. `This
post <http://www.nabble.com/--daemon-vs.-server-start-td21594587.html>`__
explains it better than anything else I've read thus far, but it's not
all that clear. Basically when you start ``emacs --daemon`` it doesn't
load your ``.emacs`` init file correctly, and so things like display
settings are off kilter, and can't really be fixed. I resorted to
running my "host" emacs frame inside of a terminal/screen session,
because that worked and was basically the same from my perspective.

Nevertheless I've discovered "the fix" to the emacs daemon it to work
like you'd expect. Run the following command at the command line
(changing username and font/fontsize):

``emacs -u [USERNAME] --daemon --eval "(setq default-frame-alist \ '((font-backend . \"xft\") (font . \"[FONT]-[SIZE]\")))" -l ~/.emacs``

And then, open an emacsclient.

... *and there was much rejoicing* ...

There are a couple of things that I *can't* get to work reliably. Most
notably, though the emacsclient works in terminal instances, it has some
sort of problem with attaching new clients to X after an X
crash/restart. No clue what this is about. Not quite sure what the deal
is with this, but needing to reboot every time X goes down is a bummer.
Other than that? Emacs bliss. For the moment.
