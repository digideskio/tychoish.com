"The government favors families a lot," said Staub, 35, a project
manager for a French cellphone company. "They understand that
families are the future. It's great for us."

-- From an article in the Washington Post.

I think on the whole, it's a nifty and long awaited idea. I mean,
children are pretty rotten, but ignoring that for a moment....

Having said that, I'd argue that families are also the past, not to
dehistorizie the development of the family or anything, but I have to
break it to you, Mde. Staub, your generation wasn't the first to have
families.

Cheers.
