==========
Hate Email
==========

I'm of two minds about email which should be a surprise to absolutely
none of you.

On the one hand, I love it. It's great to be able to shot off quick
notes and information to people without having to bother around with
post offices, telephones, IM or some-such. It's also great that in most
cases email gives you leeway on response time so that you can decide how
to prioritize your actions. Good plan, right? Right. I mean that leeway
is often the rope we use to hang ourselves, but ignoring that for a
moment, it's good conceptually.

On the other hand, bleh. Right? I mean I have a couple of emails to
write out today, that's like my main task for today, and by god I don't
want to. There's really nothing more stressful and really, frankly,
emotionally draining than writing emails to prospective advisors for
graduate school. Gah!

In other non-related news, it looks like the big gay college student
conference (that's unfortunately not the real colloquial term for that
gathering,) is going to be in *FlatCollegeTown* at the end of February.

Have I mentioned recently that I really hate writing emails to
prospective advisors?
