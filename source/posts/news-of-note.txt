-  I have subscribed to `tristram
shandy <http://www.dailylit.com/books/life-and-opinions-of-tristram-shandy-gentleman>`__,
via email. In 212 parts. In less than six months I'll be one step
closer to being even more of a dweeb. you should read tristram shandy
with me.
-  I've started a tealart redesign. I predict more
`serifs <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif>`__ in our future.
-  knitting is progressing, as is writing. I think I was in a stuck
place for a while, but despite not getting more time in my life, I've
been able to be more productive.
-  if you're waiting for an email from me, I'm probably writing it. you
should ping me though.
-  I'm about half an inch from the crazy cool part of this sweater. The
end is near, this means that I need to have a better idea about what
I'm going to do next. Ha!

Sorry for the general lack of updates. I'm still thinking of you and of
tychoish.com.
