A (gay) friend was talking about the ongoing drama of his parents
(decades old) divorce. I said, "I don't get this whole [gay] marriage
thing."

"Right," he said.

"I mean, whatever, but I think we need to work on convincing straight
people to *not* get married rather than convincing states to let us get
married," I said.

"It'll never happen," he said.

"Right, besides we'd need better Corporate law, and good luck seeing
that happen," I said. "I mean what we really need are ways to
incorporate sustainable co-operatives without the concepts/burdens
for-profit/non-profit entities."

Which is, if you've ever wondered, what its like to live in my head.

When we get down to the heart of the issue, marriage has a lot to do
with inheritance, powers of attorney, legal agent-representation stuff
(is that different than powers of attorney), relationships and families
are orthogonal.

This isn't to say that either the importance of the combined legal
entity of a married couple *or* the legal recognition of a
relationship/family isn't a valuable institution, but marriage seems to
be a poor implementation of either and both.
