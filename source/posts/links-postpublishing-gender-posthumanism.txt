For your consideration:

-  `Paul Grahm on the Future of
Publishing <http://www.paulgraham.com/publishing.html>`__, which is
of corse pretty darn spot on. Follow up, I guess to `this link from
the last link dump
post <http://www.niemanlab.org/2009/09/micropayments-for-news-the-holy-grail-or-just-a-dangerous-delusion/>`__.
I think it's generally true to say that the "post-publishing" world
is here, as most writers/content producers--or the young and
successful ones at any rate--are already working in post-publishing
business models.

-  `SF Signal Mind-Meld about Short Fiction
Anthologies <http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2009/09/mind-meld-behind-the-sceneshow-the-hottest-short-fiction-anthologies-are-created-part-1/>`__.
In a lot of ways I think short fiction "anthologies" are a great
thing and answer a lot of needs in publishing. It's a sustainable way
to publish short fiction (in the way that magazines aren't terribly,)
anthologies have the potential to be greater than the sum of their
parts (and thus better than single author short story collection.)
And they're typically great fun to read. The aforelinked article does
a great job of showing the thought process of the editors and
anthologists that make these collections possible.

-  `Organic Memory Transfer and
neurotechology <http://www.hplusmagazine.com/articles/neuro/will-we-eventually-upload-our-minds>`__,
I'm more interested in the limitations of input/output than in the
"brute power" problems that Katz raises in this article, but its
interesting.

-  `The Professionalization of
blogging <http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200909u/professional-bloggers>`__
As an independent blogger myself, this article seems to mostly be
true, though I'm not particularly happy about it, I must say. I'm
interested in how the rise of the "big professional blog" integrates
with the ongoing collapse of the media industry.

-  `Rough Type - Questioning
Accidentalism <http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2009/09/accidentally_on.php>`__
I seem to be on a "posting links about the media today." This one, is
pretty historiographical, which is an approach to this "evolution of
media" topics that I approve of with great vigor. I just wish there
were a way to sort of say to the world, "lets do something
*different* this time." Alas.

-  `Gender in the Free Software
World <http://gabriellacoleman.org/blog/?p=1768>`__ no matter how far
away from Women's Studies and "gender stuff," it seems to follow me.
That said, this article, which comments on `some gender-related
activism, if we can use that word, out of the
FSF <http://www.fsf.org/news/summit-on-women-in-free-software>`__.
The news is a bit old at this point (old links are old,) but I think
the analysis here is pretty much spot on, and I'm not sure if I have
anything that I could add to this. Go read. `Also
this <http://gabriellacoleman.org/blog/?p=1729>`__ which I'm still
reading/groking thinking about.

Woot. Tabs closed for now.
