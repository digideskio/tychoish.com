I wish I kept bette records of the entries that I commented in the blog
world. My memory is that it was a boing boing post, probably by Cory
Doctorow. Anyway...

There was some moaning about the fact that apple put a cryptographic
check in the new ipods to prevent them from synching with anything but
iTunes.

Well `it's been
cracked <http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/09/17/135205&from=rss>`__,
predictably I think.

I mean this is always an issue, but I never really think it's worth
getting ones' undies in a bunch. There are enough good things to get
one's underwear entangled over, anyway.
