Borne Back Ceaselessly into the Past

I've been quite enamored of the last line of F. Scott Fitsgerald's
Gatsby for some time. I mean I'm not great fan of American Literature,
and while I think there's some really brilliant material in The Great
Gatsby, on the whole I think its over done and despite it's stark tone,
I think there's just too much glamorization. But the last line, I think
is enough to make it really amazing. It's been floating around the
Quotes section for some time (it was actually the last quote I posted).
But just in case you're not familiar with it, here it is.o

Gatsby belived in the green light, the orgastic future that year by
year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no
matter--tomorow we will run faster, strech out our arms father....
And one fine morning---

So we beat on, boasts against the current, borne back ceaselessly
into the past.

--F. Scott Fitsgerald, *The Great Gatsby*

There's something poetic and magical about those words, and they've been
the source of a lot of inspiration. I wrote a short story, that has some
promise, and on a whim I did a sketch that I'm going to print as an
plexy glass engraving (intaglio/dry point). I might post the story on
TealArt at some point, and I'm going to stick in the drawing in a bit.
It's pencil and paper, that I went over with marker and then scanned
into the computer. I've taken that scan and provided a little bit of
tone for the digital display, and I think it looks pretty good,
considering that I drew it.
