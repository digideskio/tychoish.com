*Days on the waitlist:* 1

As it turns out the woman who found the cat has decided to keep it. So
no cat. I'll probably scope out the animal shelters just to see, but I
think this means I'll wait on the cat till I move out on my own.
Hopefully the fall. That'll make things easier I think. In any case this
is the second time that we've almost gotten a cat but had it fall
through. (A dancing-friend's daughter's (siamese) cat had kittens in the
late summer, and we wanted one, but it didn't work out).

These things happen.

Not much else in the way of news.

**Knitting Department** I got my extra skein of yarn in the mail for
this sweater, so though I'm not making a lot of progress there (it's so
fine) I really want to get this sweater knocked out. It's been too long,
and I need closure. There will be pictures. My goal is the end of the
weekend for the sleeve, and this time next week with the hem and
business.

**Television and Knitting Department** I've been watching the second
season of Boston Legal during my knitting, which I do so enjoy. I think
I have Blake's 7 and Jeremiah on my computer to watch, but I've found
the pacing on the former to be *frightful* and the second one to be...
difficult, at the moment. We'll see what I try next. I think there'll be
torchwood to watch tomorrow.

I'll be around. See you...
