Cooler Nicknames

Much to my continual amusement and wonder, one of the most enduringly
popular TealArt entries is `Cool
Nicknames <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/cool-nicknames/>`__, which I
wrote when I stopped blogging as RealName, and started using tycho.
Clearly people are in search of cool nicknames, and they stumble on the
page from google, and frankly, while I would always welcome more readers
of this site, that's probably the one entry that I would be perfectly
happy if no one ever read again, but here I am linking to it, so go
figure.

Anyway, once upon a time, I was a huge fan of blogging under my real
name, but more recently, I've started to feel like I want to have more
control over that name, and I guess I didn't want a casual connection
between my endeavors in science fiction and any academic work that I
might end up doing in the future. Also, as a student of identity, I
think the pen names and assumed names are really fascinating, and
something that should be played with.

And so, I have, in some circumstances, become tycho. While I quite like
being the blogger known as "tycho," I'm a little unsatified with this
for a couple of reasons:

1. I have a connection with my old name on these sites which isn't
really going to be removed, and there are a couple of online forms
that for one reason or another, I still go by my given name it.
2. tycho, until now, hasn't had a surname, which, and we can't all be
prince.
3. Connections between TealArt/tychoish, and published work related to
TA/TY content. While clearly I have yet to decide anything, I've
toyed with the idea of putting together some of my work (knitting and
science fiction) in book form, and I'm unsure what the best way to
credit this would be. I think tycho is perfect for the science
fiction, but I think knitting might go best under my real name, but
I'm not sure, it's something to think about.

Anyway, on the surname question, I've thought of adding a number of
things: family names that are in danger of dying out, parts of my real
name, initials, so forth. I wanted something that was meaningful, but
that also sounded good, something that was uncommon but not unheard of
or hard to pronounce by english speakers, and something that had a
little jewish tinge to it. The name tycho, comes from an old obsession,
but also from a character that I was quite fond of in my first very
unpublished [1]_ novel, named "Tycho Morgan," I liked that but, didn't
want to take that name, and it wasn't right. After some pondering, I've
gone back to the names that I use in that book, and I think I've decided
on "garren [2]_" as a good surname. "tycho garren" looks good, it works
in the vague way that jews name after people, and it marks a connection
to a project that means something to me.

tycho garren [3]_. I like it.

cheers, tycho

ps. sorry, I don't have a list of cool nicknames for you. I hope you
enjoy the site though.

.. [1] And very unpublishable. But it's for the best.

.. [2] Garren was the name of one of the ships in that book.

.. [3] Why do I avoid capitalizing it? Because it isn't my given name,
   because I think it looks better typographically (and in my own
   script) without caps, and I like that way.
