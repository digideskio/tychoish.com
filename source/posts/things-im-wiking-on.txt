Things I'm Wiking On

- `The Contra Purity Test </wikish/contra-purity/>`__: A couple
  friends and thought it might be cool to work on a "purity test" for
  contra dancing/dancers. Mostly for jokes, I said "I'll make a wiki
  page," and then I did. It is, I'd say 70% done.

- Some writing and thinking about `TumbleManager, tumblelog engine
  <http://wiki.cyborginstitute.net/tumblemanager/>`__ in response to
  `this post
  <http://tychoish.com/posts/tumblr-killed-the-tumblelog-star/>`__.
  I'm writing this as a design document/spec sheet because I'm a
  writer and my brain works like this.

- The `Lessons from System Administration </wikish/archives/>`__ is
  the beginning of an `archive <http://tychoish.com/archive/>`__ of
  posts that I've written recently drawing lessons learned in system
  administration into other more generally useful contexts.

- `Sygn Networking <http://wiki.cyborginstitute.net/sygn/>`__ - I've
  done some editing recently on this older project with an attempt to
  move it forward. Reorganization, cleaning up of text, adding new
  points in where they make sense. Of particular interest is, I think
  the `data examples
  <http://wiki.cyborginstitute.com/sygn/dataexamples/>`__ of what sygn
  profiles might look like. I hope this all helps illuminate the
  project a bit.

- Although this only barely counts: I did some very wiki-like editing
  to the `tubmlelog post
  <http://tychoish.com/posts/tumblr-killed-the-tumblelog-star/>`__,
  which I think cleaned up the text a bit. I'm, as you're aware, not a
  very polished sort of writer. But I think I'm pretty good at
  cleaning things up after a fashion, and once I have the right
  distance. Or something. It's a bit clearer now, at any rate.

- Also not wiki related specifically, but I've been doing some rolling
  revisions on the `Cyborg Institute <http://cyborginstitute.net>`__
  website recently. I don't want the CI project to die, but I want it
  to be more realistic, and useful to other people as a platform for
  some really awesome projects. I think by focusing the site, and
  pulling out some cruft we're getting in that direction.

In addition to the above, I wanted to explore the possibility of doing
more posts like this occasionally as a way of saying "Hey! I'm working
on cool things like the stuff I write about here, but the stuff isn't
getting posted *here*. Check them out" is that a valuable use of this
space? Or would this tedious?

Onward and Upward!
