Because I promised another post, and I must admit that I don't have very
much to talk about, here comes a list.

-  Sleep readjustment is going well, and I'm pretty pleased. I think I
need to push myself a little bit more. I have the waking at 7/7:30
thing down pretty well, but I have been rolling over at 4:30 and
going back to bed when I should really just get up then.

-  I'm doing better with the stress level, distraction helps. All I can
do is wait after all

-  I haven't really been knitting much. I need to change that, but I
feel like there are more important things to do, so I'm doing them

-  I've switched to a book bag that almost always makes my spine feel
(though not actually) feel like it's falling apaprt after a week. I
really like the bag, but it doesn't like me. This is usually a sign
that I need a new book bag. I know what I want, and it's been about a
year since I've gotten a new bag. I'm going to start trolling ebay,.

-  The weather in *homeCity* is very schizoid it was in the 50s when I
left for work, the low 40s when I got to work, and in the teens or
below when I got home. I just want it to be nice and cold, and
consistent.

-  I've been stewing over this for a while, but I'm thinking that I'll
start to post little snippits of the breakout hypertext from time to
time on tychoish. I have one or two that I think would work, but I
need to work with them a little bit. Progress is slow because I'm
mostly focusing on doing what amounts to editing the older stuff.

-  I'm failing at my reading program, but as I get better at sleeping
correctly, my hope is that I'll be able to write and work from 5-6
until whenever I have to leave the house, and then I'll use the
evening to read, spin and knit.

-  *I think we're going to be placing the order for my new spinning
wheel. I've decided that I'm going to be ordering a number of extra
ratios as well* **Sqee!**

-  For a morning getting this `wordpress
mu <http://mu.wordpress.org/>`__ thing to work was pretty good.

-  I'll be able to do everything that I wanted to do and more using
MU. It needs some work, and I have to set up the new sites, of
course, but I like the possibilities that are opening up. This
also makes doing things like podcasting will be really really
straightforward once it happens.
-  At some point tychoish will move back in with tealart, (and I hope
as will chris' site, though that's up to him,) nothing, would, I
think, actually change from your perspective, but it makes me
happy to be able to use *one true system to run them all.*

I'd hate to see a list when I actually did have something to say. *sigh*

Onward and Upward!
