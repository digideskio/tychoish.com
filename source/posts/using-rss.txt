I just wanted to check to see if you all use RSS, and if so I have a few
questions:

- Is one of the primary ways you interact with content on the web?

- What software do you use to read feeds? (Google Reader? NetNewsWire?
Lifrea? Newsbeuter? FeedGator/FeedDemon? LiveJournal?).

- What's your biggest pet peeve about the RSS ecosystem? (including
feed readers, feed parsers, variations in feed
generation/publication, under/over adoption).

Thanks.

(my answers? yes; google reader; non-full text feeds and generally
lackluster reading options.)

I look forward to hearing what you have to say.
