One of the things that I find a lot when I'm seraching the internet for
emacs things (or, in the case of my `google
alert <http://www.google.com/alerts/>`__, when emacs stuff on the web
finds me.) Are people writing blog posts that are along the lines of,
"so I was playing around with emacs `weblogger
mode <http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WebloggerMode>`__..." Which is
pretty much what this is.

I've been toying with the idea of switching to a
`git <http://www.git-scm.com>`__-based blogging platform/site generator,
that would be much more slim than my current tool, which (though I love
it, and recomend it to other people regularly) doesn't seem to fit my
workflow particularly well. Since leaving the (wonderful) TextMate
blogging bundle behind, I've been in search of a blogging tool... and,
well, I'm still looking.

When I find it, I assure you that you'll be the first to know.
