===================
Red Sweater of Doom

So, I'm making this red sweater. I've talked about it before.

Ok. I'm nearing the close of the first sleeve and I have not yet used
all of the *first half* of my yarn supply. That's right. I think there
will be some trading at some point of the darker color, which I'm pretty
unlikely to use ever again in my life. Probably, who knows.

I'm beginning to think through my next sweater project, which is a long
way off, because, including sweaters that need sleeves, I have like four
sweaters in progress. Five if you count the interminable fingering
weight sweater knit at 12 stitches to the inch.

So maybe it's more like five sweaters. Sigh. I think I'd like to have
the grey sweater plus only one more on sleeves before I start another
sweater [1]_. For the past three years I've always started a sweater
during thanksgiving week and finished it before christmas, and I'd like
to do that again, but I might go for just finishing a couple of
sweaters. I might be able to get all of all my sleeves that I want to
get done by then, but the other project is too long. Sigh.

--------------------

In other news, I did some practice GRE work. The computer screwed
up, so I don't have a good sense of my math section score, and because
of computer screwing up (it meant my practice today was shorter, and
didn't mimic real test situations enough...) I don't have a
statistically accurate view of the verbal section, but I'm pretty
pleased with how I did on this section.

What this tells me is that I can do really damn good on this test, my
actual score is/will be an issue of endurance rather than anything
intrinsic. Back to practicing.

.. [1] Typically the grey is the project that I bring to movies for knitting
   in the dark, when I don't have another project because it's so
   mindless and easy.
