As you might know, for a good deal of my college career I was (one of)
the ringleader(s) for our campus queer organization (indeed, between the
queer group and the feminist co-op, there was only one semester where I
wasn't over involved.)

Anyway, the queer group always had an end of semester bash called wine
and cheese. Frankly I'm not sure how we got away with it, I think
technically because it was always early in the evening and we had an
invite list, rather than just opening the door, everyone just let it be.
Anyway. So we had an invite list that we always generated before the
party. It was made up of:

1. People who participated in our events.
2. Our friends who we wanted to party with.
3. Professors and advisors who weren't associated with the student-life
folks (and thus wouldn't report us.)
4. Other clubs (like the feminist co-op) that we wanted to support
alliances between.
5. Queers in the community, who might not have come to our events but
were at least tangentially supportive, that we wanted to reciprocate
the support.
6. People who had previously been part of our little ring-leading group.
7. People we had crushes on/people we thought might be queer.

Note that categories 5 and 7 had very little overlap, indeed category 6
had little overlap with any other category.

I dunno, but that strikes me as being pretty darn funny, particularly in
retrospect.

By the end of my time at *AlmaMater* I was pretty happy to be done, and
I was more than ready to be done with the ring leading of the queer
group. But now, I kinda miss that party, as odd as it always was.
