Babel-18

I guess I didn't have time to mention this the other day, but I finished
reading Babel-17 by Samuel Delany. It was great, and I quite liked the
way that it wrapped up.

I posted earlier about how I had the perpetual feeling of not getting
the story, but I think it totally worked out, and I will totally accept
that I was pretty scatter brained while I was reading the book, and it
took me too long, so it's probably my fault. I enjoyed it none the less,
and while I'm not going to start reading it for a second time (or
frankly, reading "Empire Star," the accompanying novella) quite yet, I
will re-read this.

From here, I think I'm going to spend some time with the short story
collection that I bought a while back. I'm usually not one for short
stories, but I think it's important that I at least try. That sounds
like the beginning of a doomed project, and perhaps it is. However:

1. I'm not going to avoid starting to read a novel because I want to
read this.
2. I don't plan to read it sequentially.
3. I'm actually quite interested in most of these authors and their
work, so I hope that curiosity is worth something.

Onward and Upward!
