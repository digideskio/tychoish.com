My friend `Jeff Kirvin <http://www.jeffkirvin.net>`__'s website require
registration for commenting, so because I'm lazy I'm going to reply to a
couple of things here:

Secondly--and this follows right from my `last
response <http://tychoish.com/tychoish/2007/06/mobile-device-useage/>`__--Jeff
posted about the
`Foleo <http://www.jeffkirvin.net/2007/05/30/foleo-are-you-freaking-kidding-me/#comments>`__,
a new laptop-replacement/mobile device from Palm Inc.

Jeff panned the concept, and I think in a lot of ways he's right--from
the geek perspective. Folks like us--geeks, off-label users--wouldn't
have a lot of use for something like this, we'd either take a laptop, or
be content with the smaller device. And the price is really quite high.
I'm not sure how businesses will take to this device. It's hard to say.
I won't be getting one, that's for sure; but I think the concept is a
pretty neat one.

When apple stopped producing 12 inch laptops, a lot of people cried out
in anguish(!), and one of the most persistent rumors in mac-land for
many years has been a tablet/sub-notebook kind of computer. Something
thin: no CD drive, solid state storage, a good keyboard, good battery
life, etc. And the Foleo has wi-fi, so really, what more do you need?

The Foleo sounds a lot like this dream product, so at least the concept
for the Foleo, is a keeper, even if the implementation sucks. Frankly
I'd be a lot more comfortable if it were running a flavor of OS X (over
a Palm OS flavor) but such is life.
