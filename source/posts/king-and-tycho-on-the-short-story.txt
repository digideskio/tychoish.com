King and tycho on the Short Story

Stephen King, fresh off of editing the *Year's Best Short Stories 2007*
(well probably not), wrote `an essay for the New York Times about "What
Ails the Short
Story" <http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/books/review/King2-t.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&pagewanted=print>`__.

I must admit I've never been terribly fond of King. I think he's a bit
heavy handed, and I thought that *On Writing* was disgusting. But that's
just me. Interesting then that we should both be on the same side of
this argument.

The short story as a form is in trouble, and I think that the lack of
good publication venues with good audiences is a big problem, but it's
only part of the picture. Other factors that I'd consider:

- Mainstream short story conventions tend toward the experimental,
  which precludes a lot of audience, because we are taught how to read
  experimental texts. For good or ill.
- Short stories also tend to be pretty conceptual (and this includes
  Science Fiction, alas), and conceptual work is also pretty hard to
  read, and not what I'd call classically *fun*. Interesting? Yes.
  Thought provoking? Yes. Important? Yes. Enjoyable? Only sometimes if
  you're lucky.
- It's hard to read short stories before bed. I suspect that most
  people do their fiction reading before they go to bed as "winding
  down" short stories can be read quickly, but are hard to get into
  when you're tired.
- A lot of people who would have, in previous times, written short
  stories are writing other things: novels, blogs, etc. This isn't a
  bad thing, so much as a "media and art change" fact.
- The novel has gotten shorter. Whereas once 100k words was sort of the
  bare-minimum for a novel length work, we're seeing more novels in the
  60k-80k range. This is still a bunch longer than the short story, but
  there has to be some compression effect downstream.
- Short fiction seems to be the best/only way to teach people how to
  write fiction. It's not a huge commitment to a project, you can play
  around with ideas and techniques without wasting months of your time.
  I think we should give fiction writers who want to write novels or
  poetry the opportunity and encouragement to train for that
  separately.

Having said that, I think that podcasting represents a great hope for
the short story. I find short stories pretty hard to read in most
cases [1]_, but when they're read to me, I often find that I can really
enjoy the stories and get into them.
`EscapePod <http://www.escapepod.org>`__ is a great example of
this [2]_. And while I think the
`365Tomorrows <http://www.365tomorrows.com/>`__ project is brilliance, I
can pretty much only absorb these stories only in the podcast form,
`Voices of Tomorrow <http://www.voicesoftomorrow.org/>`__, and there is
of course `The Voice of Free Planet X <http://planetx.libsyn.com/>`__,
which is great fun.

This also forces us to consider the difference between literary and
science fiction short stories. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm not sure
that other than the New Yorker, Playboy, Harpers, and the Atlantic
Monthly, there are literary short story publications that pay authors.
Not that the SF markets pay all that well, but I think that's worth
something. SF pubs have to pay their authors in order to be taken
seriously [3]_, and some of the most respect literature-literary
markets, don't. Thus is in better shape, I think: Escape Pod is a huge
force in this, but in the last decade I think we've seen an increase in
pro-level markets: `Jim Baen's Universe <http://baens-universe.com/>`__,
`Orson Scott Card's IGMS <http://www.intergalacticmedicineshow.com/>`__,
and `Strange Horizon's <http://www.strangehorizons.com/>`__ are--I
hope--a signal of good things to come. Maybe.

Despite podcasts and new markets; despite my loyalties to the science
fiction community/movement/genre, I still don't really want to read
short fiction. So in the end I think I have to agree with Mr. King. The
short story is in trouble, particularly the literary short story.

.. [1] There are cases when I will (and do) gladly read short fiction: when
   I'm really interested in an author, or in the concept that they're
   writing about, but I tend to think of short fiction reading in the
   same way that I think about reading essays and monographs.

.. [2] Steve, sorry, I've been behind. I just saw that you bought another
   `Nancy Kress
   Story <http://escapepod.org/2007/09/27/ep125-end-game/>`__, and I'm
   pretty excited about this. Woo!

.. [3] `SFWA <http://www.sfwa.org>`__ can be pretty boneheaded some/most of
   the time, but insofar as they function as a labor union for SF
   writers, I kinda like them, and that side of their influence.
