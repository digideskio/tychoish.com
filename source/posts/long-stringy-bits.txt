I'm so going to write a post about how piss-poor the databases for
scholarly articles are when I have time. They need to hire a web 2.0
developer, for real, because whatever their using (some arcane home
grown perl system no doubt) blows. And there's no reason that they
couldn't offer desktop clients, which for this kind of service makes a
hell of a lot of sense. It's an interesting development question,
because their business model is so different from every other web
service. Coming soon!

I have to go to class soon (and take a test! on speech production and
language learning, but I'm feeling pretty good about it) and then work
in the yarn store which is going swimmingly. Spinning group tonight, but
I'm not going to have a wheel there. Interestingly I have a hard time
working on my own projects when I'm there, and I come home and I'm not
incredibly interested in knitting or doing much spinning. The end result
is that I haven't been working on my own projects very much, but I seem
(somehow) to be getting lots of things done, so there's nothing really
to complain about.

Onward and Upward!
