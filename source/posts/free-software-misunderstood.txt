This post is in response to two things that I've observed recently:

1. `A Misinformed Critique of the Debian
Project <http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/debian_contempt_end_user_values_has_stop>`__

2. `The largely unfair dismissal of free software/open source/hackers on
the grounds of purported
zealotry <http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=4554>`__.

Debian, Critiqued
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The above linked article, presents a number of critiques, leveled at the
Debian project. While these complaints with user experience are valid, I
was left with a serious, as we say on the Internet "WTF" moment. Read
the article if you haven't already before you get to my response, if
you're so inclined.

Also I'd like to challenge the Editors of that website to exercise a
little more digression in what they publish in the future.

My response:

1. Stable releases of Debian are for the most part not intended to be
run as desktop operating systems. The software in Debian Lenny is, at
this moment nearly two years old. That's fine (and even desirable)
for a server, but most users want things that are a little more up to
date than that. This is why we have distributions like Ubuntu, which
manages to walk a much better line between stable (and benefits from
the efforts of Debian) and current.

2. It's possible to install Debian packages that aren't contained in the
repository, or provided in older versions of the operating system.
Download the package with ``wget`` and then use
``dpkg -i    [package-file].deb``. There may be GUI tools that
support this. While we might like to have Linux systems for "new
comers" to the platform that don't require using the command line,
Debian stable isn't one of these operating systems.

3. Installing fonts on most systems is usually as simple as putting the
files in ``/usr/share/fonts`` or ``$HOME/.fonts`` and and running
``fc-cache -f``. The complainer focuses a great deal on the absence
of a familiar font management program (which appears to be a command
line tool that exists in Ubuntu 9.04 which is a "newer" system than
Lenny).

I still don't see how "contempt" is the right word, to describe the fact
that a massive project that is the result of a loose organization of
hundreds of people, failed the address a few specific needs of a user
using the system in a non-standard/non-recommended pattern qualifies as
"contempt for users."

As it stands it sort of feels like the author is attempting to stir up
controversy by attacking a historical weak spot, and stretching the
bounds of reasonable criticism in the process. I think editors of any
publication should be above this sort of thing. **thumbs down**.

Dismissal of Free Software on the Grounds of Zealotry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We see this a lot, and I'm kind of sick of it.

I've seen a lot of people--who actually agree with almost every tenant
of the most "ideologically pure" free software advocates--dismiss
version 3 of the GPL, or RMS, or the FSF for being "too radical," or
obsessive, or "communist," which is both intensely interesting and
intensely troubling. It's often in the form of "I wouldn't say that like
RMS," or some such.

For starters, I think its interesting to note the prevalence with which
"communist" is used as a dismissal of the "Free Software" movement,
particularly because while there is a very vague "anti-corporations" and
"anti-trust" vein in the free software world, in point of fact the
biggest "big picture political" ideology around is a very ad hoc
libertarianism. The "communist" jab is, probably more at the sort of
heavy-handed ideological positionally of the "copy left" movement.
Furthermore, I think it's probably clear that Free software as we know
it today wouldn't be possible without commercial interests, input and,
energies, and resources.

And yet. Free software/open-source, gets red baited. Interesting. And
disappointing.
