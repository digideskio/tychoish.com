=================================
Knitting Update - Concept Sweater
=================================

I just realized that the sweater I'm making right now, could very easily
be considered a concept sweater. It'll be nice to have it, and it might
be the right weight for this environment, but I'm not sure that it's
going to be "right." It'll be nifty. I've started the first part of the
yoke decreases, which means that the rounds will start going faster,
albeit very slowly.

I think I'm going to be buying one of the expensive new addi lace
needles, because I have a discount at the yarn shop for teaching a
class, and because I can feel the needle I'm currently using starting to
go, and I think most of the sweaters I make in the next year will be on
this kind of needle, so it's worth it.

Cheers!
