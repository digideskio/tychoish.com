This is a post that's just meant to keep you all updated of projects
that I've talked about recently, but haven't had time to write or talk
about extensively about recently.

-  I'm writing. Not as much as I'd like, but pretty regularly. I expect
that come hell or high water I'm going to start the new fiction site
the week of July 14th.

-  I suspect in my next post to tychoish I will cross the 400,000 word
mark for posts on this website (and tealart which proceeded it).
Thats *crazy*, though my verbosity should come as a surprise to no
one. Also, I think that July 1 is probably as good a marker as any
for my first anniversary of blogging at tychoish.com. It's been
awesome, and I'm not stopping anytime soon.

-  I'm making a formal effort to learn how to program in Python. I've
gotten the `O'Reilly <http://oreilly.com/>`__ "Learning Python" book,
and I'm enjoying it, and I think I'm at a point where I might
actually be able to make a go of this.

-  I've done a little programing in the past, mostly a little PHP
(for the website) and some shell scripting for day to day stuff
that I do around here. But I've never actually tried to learn
something, opting to just tinker around instead. But I'm starting
to get to a point where there are things that I need or want to
learn how to program, and I've decided that python is probably
*the best/only* language that I need to learn. It seems to combine
both straightforwardness with flexibility, and does away with the
aspects that I find most annoying about other languages (Perl, not
straightforward, lots of modules; PHP, not incredibly useful
outside of website programing; ruby, oy; C/C++/Objective-C too
much overhead; anything else, too marginal). So I'm looking
forward to it and enjoying it mightily.
-  Having some moderate level of proficiency in a real programing
language will--with luck--be helpful in the job search.

-  Another high level project for me at the present is my job search for
the intermediate term. I think I want to go to graduate school at
some point, but I'm more interested in doing something in the interim
that might flow into graduate school eventually, and something that
isn't just marking time. More than anything it's weird to go from
having things so thought out and certain-seeming, to not throughout
at all. I'm not sure that this is a bad thing, it's just wierd

-  Now for a couple points of geekery:

-  I've changed the color scheme for my terminal window, and as a
result have found myself using vim more often. It's teal, which is
better than the navy that it was before. Easier to read, and it's
sort of fresh and inspiring. Oddly. I like vim a lot, though I
must say that I need to spend some time learning emacs key
bindings, because I don't know them and Cocoa on the mac uses
them, so not knowing them is a hinderance.
-  I might have mentioned this earlier, but for the past eighteen
months or so I've been using
`subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org/>`__ (svn) to
organize/collect/backup my files. I write a lot (no really) and
spend my working day and night munging text files in various ways
and it makes a lot of sense to me to use version control to stay
on top of this. Anyway, I've been thinking about switching to git
recently and I think I'm going to go through with it later this
fall. Here's my thinking:

-  My current setup involves having svn repositories on my hard
drive, and then backing up dump files semi-regularly to a flash
drive and to the cloud. This replicates a lot of functionality
of git (the local repository) which makes commits fast and
frequent, but I'm unsatisfied with the backup/offsite
component.
-  Though svn solves the problem with copying and moving files and
their histories which CVS (apparently) couldn't deal with,
merging and reverting to previous versions is a royal pain in
the ass, as a result I'm not prone to doing it. Git would help
ameliorate this problem.
-  A lot of svn "features" (tagging, etc) rely on you lying out
the repository in a certain sort of way from the get go. This
is fine if you're a programer, but the truth is that I don't
often think to arrange my writing projects and whatnot in this
way, and as a result a lot of this is lost on me.
-  All the cool kids are doing it, and I'm nothing if not a
joiner. (Ha!)

-  A few weeks ago I completely hosed the installation of ruby on my
computer. Lets not talk about it. I have something marginal
working but I should probably do a reinstall of the operating
system, but I'm resistant.

I think on the whole I'm doing pretty good, I'll (of course) be in
touch.
