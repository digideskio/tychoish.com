========================
On My Return to Blogging
========================

I've been a blogging slacker in the last few months. I've been working a
lot (software releases! content migrations!) and spending my free-time
singing and working on a few odds-and-ends projects. And not blogging.

But I did this [[/rhizome/delegated-builds]] project and it seemed like
blogging about it would be good.

*And it was...*

I've had this blog, in one form or another for 10 years, and my
relationship to this blog has grown and changed a lot in that time and I
don't think it's useful to really think about all the turns *too* much,
but the recent developments are novel:

- I write for a living, and have pretty consistently for the last 4-ish
years (holy crap!) It's not exactly that I'm burnt out on writing,
but it does mean that I write differently now, which is a good thing,
but I don't always have the same ability to sit down after work and
want to write more, for fun.

- I noticed that blogging rigorously meant that I didn't really have
time to work on "research" projects, which is to say, I was putting a
lot of energy into writing about ideas and theories but not too much
time into actually doing things.

I love theory. I love working on theory, but I'm not sure I see use for
theory that doesn't interact with the world outside of it. For example,
before I started my current job I wrote some about [[technical-writing]]
here, and those theories definitely guide what I'm working on today and
I think I can stand by what I said, but I think my understanding and
knowledge of documentation has grown a lot for the experience of working
on it.

- To continue on this theme, the programming projects I've been working
on, which I haven't blogged about too much here, have been helpful in
teaching me a lot about software development, (which I've long been
fascinated by,) which improves the documentation I write and the way
I approach problems.

Furthermore, it means that things I used blog about and say "wouldn't it
be nice if a tool that did existed?" and now I spend a lot of time
thinking about how to make them exist. Which isn't to say that I'm a
really fluent programmer (yet,) but I'm not helpless.

So in short, I'm back, and I'm hopeful that in the coming weeks and
months I can use this space to talk about the things I'm working on and
help build a little bit of (mostly personal) momentum behind these
projects.

Onward and Upward!
