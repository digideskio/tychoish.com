I survived the wedding. Though my ailment seems to be coalescing, hence
the title.

The truth was that it was a nice, if by the book, sort of event, the
ceremony was brief, the party didn't drag on, and it was a pretty small
gathering.

I still hate weddings. And I developed a number of principals for better
weddings:

1. If you can't combine the ceremony with the toasts at the reception,
   there's a problem. Weddings are social events, and the major function
   of a wedding is for a community to celebrate and "bless" a
   partnership. The toasts at the reception seem like the ideal place
   for this.

   - I suggested at first that we find a way to integrate eating into the
     service, but the minister on hand noted that the goyem called this
     "communion," and I suddenly felt less creative, so we're back to the
     first option.

2. Ministers are unnecessary, except in cases where the officiant is
   basically part of the wedding party, a mutual friend or one of the
   attendants if there were an odd number of bridesmaids or some-such. I
   mean, I think that it's not too radical to suggest that if people
   *really* want to get married, they should be capable of doing it
   themselves, at least ceremonially.

3. Wear jeans. Duh.

4. Gotta have morris dancers.

I could blather on here about how the marriage laws are antiquated in
many ways (they are), or how there needs to be a cultural re-imagining
of marriage (there does), but I think I won't. It's a sort of tired
topic, and I'm not sure what reenacting this debate would do here.

And the truth is, that on some greater level even if I think
marriage--particularly the rituals associated with it--is foolish, I'm
not particularly opposed to specific marriages, particularly if they're
grounded in independent and freethinking.

But weddings still suck.
