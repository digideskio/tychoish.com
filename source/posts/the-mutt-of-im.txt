The Mutt of IM

You all probably know that I'm working strengthing my
linux/\ `bash <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash>`__ chops so that I can
build a much needed desktop computer (after going on 6 years of being
laptop only, it'll be nice to have something a... bit bigger.)

It's not that I don't like OS X, or Apple, it's that... I like
`awesome <http://awesome.naquadah.org>`__. And I want larger/more
screens. And other than `fluid.app <http://fluidapp.com/>`__, and
`TextMate <http://macromates.com/>`__, (and
`adium <http://www.adiumx.com/>`__ in a way) I basically live in linux
world, with a different desktop enviroment. Also, a really swell desktop
setup for a linux box that would do most of what I need would run me,
oh, about half the price of an iMac, or less.

So I have a virtual machine instance of Ubuntu running on my laptop, as
part of an effort to get used to everything ahead of time. With VM tools
beeing as cheap and fast as they are today, I think a lot of people
could really benefit from using VMs more. In any case, I've been trying
apps out and using it to get (more) comfortable with
`vim <http://www.vim.org/>`__ and working on solving all of the problems
that I'm likely to run into *now* rather than later. I'll be reporting
on this more in the future, for sure.

While most things have gone pretty seamless, the one program that I use
that I haven't been able to even come close to replacing is
`Adium <http://www.adiumx.com/>`__. Here's the thing. Adium is a OS
X-ification of a linux program called
"`pidgin <http://www.pidgin.im/>`__\ " which, despite boasting a near
identical feature set is considerably less...something. While it's
polished and totally operational, it's not... coherant and maybe it's
only really noticeable in light of using Adium. The problem is that
*every* other IM client for linux is worse. There's a command line
version of pidgin called
`finch <http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Using%20Finch>`__ which looks
like it's trying *really* hard to be a
`GUI <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface>`__ rather
than really letting the simplicty of the command line give rise to a
clearer interface model. There's a great jabber/xmpp client called
`mcabber <http://www.lilotux.net/~mikael/mcabber/>`__, but jabber
adoption is still really low, and while there are interoperability
measures with other protocols, the truth is that most of my contacts are
on other systems, and the interoperability transports aren't incredibly
reliable. If someone knows of something that I've missed I'd love to
hear what people use (and like).

So I was bemoning this (the end of this story is that I'm figuring out a
way to live with pidgin), with `chris <http://www.cgkreality.com/>`__
and he said of jabber, "It--like
`IMAP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol>`__--is
a great idea and a good protocol, the implementations are universally
horrible." (or something like that) and he's *right*, and I think this
goes for most IM clients. They all, to use a technical term, suck. [1]_
Chris' comparison to IMAP and mail clients reminded me of the slogan of
my favorite email client, `mutt <http://www.mutt.org/>`__.

"All email clients suck, mutt just sucks less."

And it does. I save hours every week using mutt, and I'm no where near a
power user (yet.) So the question on my mind is, "where's the mutt of IM
clients?" Here's what I think it would look like:

- It would need to connect to AIM, Yahoo and Jabber. This is my
  personal prefrence. MSN is pretty irrelevant to me, an ICQ these
  days *is* AIM. Multiple connections would be good.

- I think the interface should draw on the mutt with sidebar
  model. IMs needn't fill a whole window, and the sidebar works really
  well.

- It needs to have some understanding of a tabbed interface. While I
  understand that many people (and to some degree, myself included)
  don't actively particpate in more than one chat at a time, I often
  have more than one window open at a time. Conversations go dormant,
  people step out, you have to ask a quick question, there bots on the
  IM network feeding you (useless) information. Tabs are necessary.

- It'd be better if the program was able to consistently manage and
  sync the contact/buddy list, and handle meta-contacts, than be able
  to do file transfers, or mutli-user chats.

- Granular access controls. The networks I believe, allow you to set
  yourself invisible to certian people, and it would be really great
  to be able to write rules about which buddies got what kind of
  status/visibility settings.

- The key to "the mutt of" anything is the ability to take whatever
  you do, and bind it to a particular key command. So I'd like to be
  able to have "IM `Chris <http://www.cgkreality.com/>`__" bound to
  something, or be able to set various screen names visible or
  invisible depending on my context or trigger different complex
  visibility rules.

I think there's possibility. Thoughts? How do you manage your IM? [2]_

.. [1] Even my beloved Adium, which operates as expected in most
   respects is compleatly inconsistent in how it stories and syncs the
   buddy list to the server. Or doesn't depending on the
   weather. Highly annoying.

.. [2] Before anyone gets high-and-mighty about IM being a waste of
   time and attention, I generally use IM as a phone replacement
   because I can multi-task it, and becasue it doesn't have voicemail,
   and because it's almost always less awkward. Just saying. n
