Sally Free and Easy

I don't have a lot of news to post. Maybe that's a good sign. I'm doing
better, I think.

It's a shame I spent all of my free time in the last few days feeling so
crummy: at least I made some knitting progress. The good news is that
I'm going to be well groomed (haircut in a few), and fed (just finished
breakfast), and I'll have run an important errand before work. So rock
on.

I present you with a youTube gem:

This is a video of three men singing in a doorway, and that's about it.
The song is "Sally Free and Easy" which is a Cyril Tawney song, but my
dad (and I seem to agree that it's a very Bert Jansch sort of song.)
Anyway, what's remarkable is that the guy on the right is none other
than the amazing "Nic Jones." Nic Jones was/is an amazing guitar player
and singer who stopped performing in the early (?) eighties after
sustaining rather serious injuries in a car accident, this is made even
more tragic by virtue of the fact that the bulk of--and arguably--his
best albums [1]_ have been held hostage by a record company determine to
*not* rerelease them to CD.

Sigh.

Anyway, it's good to see him singing. It's good to hear such a cool
song. And it's good to see that the kind of singing that I most enjoy
(little groups of people singing in doorways) is alive and well. It's
something that can't really be recorded, but it's nice to know that it's
still around.

The "Noah's Arc Trap" and "From a Devil to A Stranger" from 1977 and
'78, I believe. Amazing pieces of work. Amazing stuff.
