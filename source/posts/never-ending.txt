I'm still not totally settled into my new routine, and I think that's
apparent in the blog. These things happen, and I just realized that this
is the third summer in a row with some sort of major life change. Maybe
I've forgotten how to exist in a summer routine. While I should probably
give myself a break, I think it's more realistic to accept a certain
level of disruption as "the new normal," and figure out how to develop a
routine around that. That's the hope at any rate. So, I'm getting there,
slowly.

I've posted a number of new rhizomes in the last week. They are:

- :doc:`Security isn't A Technological Problem </posts/security-isnt-a-technological-problem>`, A post in
  my series about addressing problems in IT as human-issue, that need
  documentation and training rather than more software.

- :doc:`These Shoes Were Made for Cyborgs </posts/these-shoes-were-made-for-cyborgs>`, which attempts
  to limit the potential for overly expansive theorizing of "the
  cyborg," in a common but not overly productive manner.

- :doc:`Little Goals and Big Projects </posts/little-goals-and-big-projects>`, a list of projects
  that I want to work on. Think mid-year resolutions meet five-year
  plan, meet time management review.

  I've also done some maintenance (gardening?) on the wiki and added or
  edited the following pages:

- I imported some comments from Facebook regarding my
  :doc:`intellectual-practice </posts/intellectual-practice>` post
  onto the discussion page.  These comments are pretty valuable and
  I've found the conversation useful, hopefully you will too. Feel
  free to add your own comments there.

- Similarly, I imported some comments onto the discussion 
  for the :doc:`Career Pathways </posts/career-pathways>` post.

- In response to one of the comments the Intellectual Practice
  post, I put together a pedagogy page, including some *very* rough
  descriptions of "writing classes I wish I'd taken and would love to
  teach."

- I also dumped a :doc:`technical writing link </technical-writing/links>`
  on a new page, that I might start using for collecting some content
  that might (or not)

- Not strictly tychoish related, but I revised my personal profile at
  `tychogaren.com <http://tychogaren.com/>`__ to be a bit more up to
  date and generally less weird/awkward.
