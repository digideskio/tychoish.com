Every day I think of the scientists who mashed up rat brains to
create the drugs that brought me back to life, and Iâ€™m grateful. --

A friend sent me the link to this essay a few days ago, and I found it a
particularly interesting read. I thought I'd share it here. While I
enjoy the authors account, I think there is one aspect that is
particularly oversimplified. While I think a more holistic look at
mental illness is overdue, I also thing that mental illness is more
about "degree" than many physical illnesses. Since emotions and thought
aren't as directly obersvable as physical qualities, there's more gray
area to be deciphered. Phyisicalizing things like depression, is
appropriate, but it's also incredibly difficult, and I think more
difficult to do casually than I think anyone would like.

But the above article is good, and really well written to boot.

Cheers, tycho(ish)
