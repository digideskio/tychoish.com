At least I'm on the right track.

In other news, I've had a sort of organizational bankrupcy moment (where
you just throw your hands up and try a new system, spured by a rather

On the upside, I'm not sure that I've lost anything, truly important.

I have got to get some sort of version control something working. I just
need a good structure to start with.
