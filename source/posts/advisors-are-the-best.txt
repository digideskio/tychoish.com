`The Sexual Self: The Construction of Sexual
Scripts <http://www.vanderbiltuniversitypress.com/bookdetail.asp?book_id=4086>`__
by Michael Kimmel.

My old advisor sent me a link to this book, which was touching, and it's
nice because the book is spot on and I totally want to read it. Also, I
like how Kimmel, who was someone who I read a lot back in the day is
doing things that are really interesting to me.

Anyway. Father, if you're reading this, since you have academic library
privileges....
