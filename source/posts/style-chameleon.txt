When I started my current job there were three major problems with the
documentation:

- There was too much duplicated content, so it was difficult to know
  where to point people.

- Given that there were always multiple versions of the product in
  use, it was hard to figure out which paragraph refereed to which
  version, particularly as the product changed.

- Each page felt like it was written by someone else (it was!) and the
  reading experience could be quite jarring.

The first two were huge tasks, but the  solutions were pretty straight
forward: build system for documentation that was structured such that
it could theoretically hold all the information (replace lots of
information repositories with a single information repository) and
then use maintenance branches in a version control system to snapshot
and fork off old branches as they're released.

Done.

The last problem is harder. Much harder.

I did a pretty good job, at first, of just writing everything myself,
which meant that the first drafts all sounded like they were written
by one person: because they were. This doesn't scale. The next step
was to edit the hell out of all contributions that weren't by me.

This also doesn't scale.

There are some canonical solutions: write a long style guide and try
to get people to comply with it; use templates and standard formats
for documents so that everything uses common structure and forms. It's
still hard to enforce, but it's something.

I put a lot of time into content reuse systems that had
additional structure. It helps, and reduces some editorial overhead,
but has the same weak points as the conventional solution.

At some point, you need actual humans to edit and make sure things are
clear and consistent across the entire corpus. If you don't have the
resources for good editors, then either writers have to spend a
significant amount of time editing, which is a huge time suck (and
slows progress,) or you start to get drift.

I'm not sure that we have a good answer yet. In the mean time

Appendices
----------

Style in Group Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. As you innovate and improve it's *really* hard to resist the
   impulse to go back to older pieces to revise them. You should make
   passes through all your content on some sort of schedule, but you
   have to give yourself permission and allowance to go back and fix
   style later.

2. Common style is less about "being right," and more about figuring
   out the kind of communication that's appropriate for the target
   audience(s) and using effective structure to support them. In
   short: compromise.

3. Style is about the entire reading expenses, not just the syntax, or
   the typesetting: it is both of these things as well as others. For
   some kinds of texts, the trick is to often to write as few words as
   possible, and to make it so that people can scan through documents
   as quickly as possible while only reading the sections that are
   relevant to them.

Personal Observations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's actually interesting to write blogs again, as I'm
(re?)discovering a style of writing that I have been very comfortable
with in the past but haven't really exercised recently. It's also
interesting to see how my own writing and writing process has changed
as a result of writing so much technical material.
