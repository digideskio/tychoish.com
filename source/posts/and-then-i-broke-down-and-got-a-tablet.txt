Ok, I caved and got a tablet. This is a post about my experiences with
the tablet and some general thoughts on the format.

I opted for the Motorola Xoom. It's an Android device, I appreciate the
Motarola build quality, and I'm very pleased with my choice. First
impressions first:

- Reading on the tablet is great. I have a Kindle, and while I respect
  how lightweight the Kindle is itself. Despite the extra weight, the
  slightly larger screen and the back light is very very nice and very
  welcome.

- I don't expect that I'll be doing a *lot* of writing on the tablet, a
  laptop is never really going to be that far away, but I'm really
  surprised by how easy it is to (*almost*) touch type on the tablet. A
  number of very simple and probably straightforward innovations to the
  keyboard could make things so much better.

- I think all devices need some sort of "don't auto rotate" hardware
  switch. In fact, I think apple's whole "lets get rid of hardware
  buttons," movement to be really annoying. Buttons should be
  overloaded, sure, but I hate having to hunt through menus to modify
  basic behavior. Having said that, the "software control bar" at the
  bottom of Android 3.0 is brilliant and a good move (given screen
  rotation.)

- I lament not having a Google voice widget for the tablet. Makes sense
  that they wouldn't want this for tablets that had data plans, but I
  just have a wifi tablet.

- The Kindle app doesn't let you bookmark your place in periodicals.
  Which might make sense if you were reading the Times, but doesn't
  make a lot of sense when reading fiction magazines with articles in
  the rage of 10k words.

- I'm in love with the calendar application, except for the "full month
  view," in which you scroll by weeks, not by months. Even with this
  glitch, I'm curious as to why there aren't (stand alone) calendar
  applications of this quality for desktops.

- I've tended to use the tablet for situations where I want to have a
  distraction free experience (usually for reading,) or where I want to
  do "computer things" in a situation where I might need to interact
  with other people. Having a tablet in your lap is more social than a
  laptop. As such, I don't think it would ever be able to replace a
  "real" computer for very long, but that doesn't make it less useful.

I'll be writing more about the tablet experience and some [[cyborg]]
features of tablet use and usability.

Onward and Upward!
