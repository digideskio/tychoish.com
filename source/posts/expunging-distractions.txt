Expunging Distractions

Context switching is hard. Focusing on a bunch of different tasks in a
short period of time is quite inefficient because you loose a lot of
time and energy switching between tasks. While the problem is obvious,
the solution or solutions aren't always particularly easy to implement
in your own life.

I've been thinking a lot about this as part of my attempt to

Common solutions are to the context switching include:

- front loading organizational and project planning work so that you
  can work on a sequence of related tasks without needing to switch
  between the modes of "doing thigns," and "planning to do the next
  thing."

- Schedule and time-box tasks so that you have have "scared time and
  space" to work on projects without needing to context switch.

- Remove periodic and open ended tasks from interrupt based work
  habits. Don't let things like "email" or "incoming work queues"
  become an excuse to lose focus or switch contexts too much.

But sometimes it's actually hard to do this. Really hard. And not just
sometimes. Often. And it's compounded by the fact that common
distractions force context switches *and* we tend to habitually do
things that are distracting during context switches, which only
increases the costs.

While I'm keen on doing things like prioritizing and scheduling time
to do specific work on a project, I'm also interested in reducing
the things that are distracting and attempting to make the context
switches as inexpensive as possible. This includes projects like:

- writing long hand in situations where I can type longer than I can
  write so that I don't context switch after every thought and can let
  my mind do creative work while my hands and eyes are engaged with
  writing.

- reducing the overall time that I spend in web browsers, which I find
  too tempting. This means only really using social networking on my
  phone, making sure that I can do email and chat outside of
  browsers. and packaging up reference materials in ways that are
  easily accessible from my coding environment.

- provide good notification collectors for myself so that I can more
  passively monitor things I care about (e.g. email, twitter, messages
  from friends,) and only really deal with the issues that seem
  critical at the time.

- do things that require movement in between tasks or projects. This
  is both good for the body and mind (generally) and useful for
  providing a non

It doesn't work all the time, of course, and I've found it interesting
to watch the kinds of things that distract me and find ways to reduce
their impact or

But these are the things *I* do, in order to improve the way that I
work. I think the general approach is good, but the specific
implementations will vary per person.

*Your mileage will vary.*
