*This is the second installment in my ongoing series on* Anti-Oedipus
*by Giles Delueze and Felix Guattari. For more information read the*
`Introduction <http://tychoish.com/>`__ \_and my\_\_ `first
installment <http://tychoish.com/>`__ *regarding a part Foucault's
preface to the book.*

I didn't want to spend too much time going over "old territory" (for me)
in *Anti Oedipus*, but I think a little bit more of background would be
helpful as we produce. I've tried to pull out the parts of the first
chapter that really stuck with me, now, almost a year after I read them
for the first time. This post introduces Deleuze and Guatteri's ideas
about *desiring production*, *recording machines*, and *breakages*.
These, at least to me, are the fundamental ideas from chapter one [1]_,
and some of the most useful ideas that I carried with me as I went on to
read further in the book.

First off, desire and production. This stuff is the foundation of their
Marx/Freud synthesis, and I think rather than unproblematically append
parts of Freud to Marx (or vice versa), they treat psychoanalysis with
the kind of skepticism that it deserves, and are able to establish a
very workable "common language." Here's what they say:

Hence everything is production: production of productions, of
actions and of passions; productions of recording processes, of
distributions and of coordinates that serve as points of reference;
productions of consumptions of sensual pleasures, of anxieties and
of pain (pg. 4).

Thinking of everything as production, including anxieties and other
"subject" experience, creates a sort of common language to talk about
subjectivity, without needing to draw on subject formation vis a vis the
mirror stage, unconsciousness, and so forth. Identities are produced,
memories are produced, bodies are produced, just as this computer, this
website, and the corn flakes you had for breakfast were produced. The
computer, corn-flakes and website, are clearly productions, but more
often than not we ignore the processes of production of memories,
identities, and bodies. This gives us reason to look at the very
smallest of effects and mechanisms and think about how their production,
rather than to be simply satisfiied with the "truth" of their
experience. Cool.

As a psychology type, the stuff about recording, is quite interesting. I
was processing this chapter for the first time right as I was writing a
paper on episodic memory (specifically autobiographical memory), so I
was thinking a lot about this. Immediately following the above quote
they say:

Everything is production, since the recording processes are
immediately consumed, immediately consummated and these consumptions
directly reproduced. This is the first meaning of process as we use
the terms: incorporating recording and consumption within production
itself, thus making them productions of one and the same process
(pg. 4).

Recording processes--communication, writing, memories, and
histories--are produced just like the corn-flakes, just like our
identities, and can and should be explored on this level. For the
record, I feel like this is an old argument that has permeated pretty
well, I suspect many feel pretty comfortable with this kind of idea.
This, though, lays the groundwork for another statement a few pages
later:

Production is not recorded in the same way it is produced, however.
Or rather, it is not reproduced within the apparent objective
movement in the same way in which it is produced within the process
of constitution (pg. 12).

We see variations on this in "Reader Response Theory" and also
Biographical/Contextual readings of literature, that look at the
contextual forces that affect the production and the consumption of a
text. We could, of course, replace "text" with "memory without any real
conceptual problem, in fact it seems more like Deleuze and Guatteri mean
*memory* in their writing, when all the literary theorists are talking
about texts, *because that's what they do*. Again, this, I think makes
it possible to analize and address both the process and the content of
memory, of *recording* on two very important levels: of its production
on the micro level, and of its content on the macro level.

Ok, moving on to the final part of this already too long post on
"breakages". At some point, Deleuze and Guatteri begin to describe
production as the combination of desire, and a machine like process, I
think I've gotten into that. I think somewhere I probably scribbled in
my notes "everything is production > desire > machines." But here is a
quote that I think descirbes how the machines [2]_ "work:"

Desiring-machines work only when they break down, and by continually
breaking down. [...] (pg 8).

I take this as an epistemological point, more than anything, but I like
how as a guiding principal this pushes us to not look toward normative
data, but toward the abnormal cases, the exceptions. These "breakages"
are interesting not only as special events, but also insofar as they
help us describe the normative functions of the system. This is why
Deleuze and Guatteri are so interested in the conceptual space of the
schizophrenic, for instance. But I think the directive to look at
breakages is a useful one [3]_.

And finally I'd like to leave you with the following quote which I found
helpful and inspiring. The one thing that I have to say about this book
is that it is--as these things go--incredibly enjoyable. It's light
hearted, it's inspiring, and it's filled with a sense of hope. And if
nothing else that's worth something...

The productive synthesis, the production of production is inherently
connective in nature: "and..." "and then..."This is because there is
always a flow-producing machine, and another machine connected to it
that interrupts or draws off part of this flow [...] (pg. 5).

I'll see you all next week. I'd love to hear what you have to say. Don't
be shy, I haven't a real clue about most of this stuff either, and I'd
love to talk. So comment!

cheers, tycho

Admittedly, the real idea from this part of the book that carries on
throughout this and *A Thousand Plateaus* is the "Body without
Organs," or in many notations BwO. This is something that seems so
simple in their explanations but that I find incredibly hard to
explain and explore, and quite frankly, hard to apply to other
situations, thoghts and projects. Maybe some other week.

The translators use the word "machine," throughout the book, and
while I think this word makes a lot of sense in context of the book,
in my own mind I've taken the word "machine" to refer to something
more like a "mechanism" or a "widget".

Clearly there is a space where anecdotal evidence isn't always a
productive part of discourse, but I think this reiterates the value
of case studies and qualatative methodologies. *Balance in all
things, after all.*
