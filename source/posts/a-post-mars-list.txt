A Post-_Mars_ List

Writing yesterday was a perfect example of the "writing is hard work and
it's painful, and miserable." Without a "but totally worth it in the
end." clause. I mean generally, I think it's rewarding, and I am glad
that I can do it, but it's not... fun and bright lights. I agonized over
it, and when it was finally over, I'm mostly just glad that I don't have
to do that again.

Having said that, because `~/tychoish <http://tychoish.com/>`__ is
really kinda like a notebook for me, I thought I'd post my working list
of "things I need to concentrate on for the next little bit now that I
don't have a huge writing project hanging on my back demanding to be
written." Here goes:

1. Read more. This is always a project of mine. I have five books, in
the immediate "to read" pile, including a book of short stories, and
a Delany novel, the Delany novel I'm in the middle of, plus a Tiptree
novella, and another Melissa Scott book. Plus things for class. I've
been pretty good about reading of late, but I can always read more
and it sometimes gets away from me.

2. Write some materials for a couple of knitting classes that I want to
be able to offer in the coming months. I want to write a "how to
knit" using the method that I developed during my WGST internship
last semester. And I also want to write a list of stylistic
guidelines for people who want to knit sweaters, so that I can teach
a "knit/design your first sweater." class, in addition to my "toe up
sock class" and intro to two color knitting class that I've already
taught.

3. *Knowing Mars*\  [1]_ work, specifically I want to give it a quick
once over and then create a PDF/HTML file so that reviewers can get a
copy pretty soon. Many of you are on my "readers" list, I'm sure, and
will get a copy to look at soon. My intention is to have two batches
of eyes look at successive versions, so that I don't get 12 people
telling me to change the same thing, and no one to tell me if the old
version was better than the first.

4. Write *Station Keeping* Seasons 2 and 3. So in my concentration on
the new project, I completely ignored my other fiction project.
Theoretically we should have started season 2 last week, but that's
not going to happen. I'd rather wait a while and then do it right,
then rush in and screw it up. It'll work out, and I've got a lot of
prep work done on it, so it makes some sense to give some attention
to the execution of the story.

5. I applied--albeit unsuccessfully--to be on the staff of futurismic, a
blog/publication that does the kind of science fiction/futuristic
stuff that I'm most interested in these days. I can however submit
articles/essays/columns to them, and I think I'd like to take
advantage of this opportunity to write about some of the ideas behind
what I'm thinking about these days. And it's a cool site.

6. Graduate school stuff. I have some work to do for school, including a
really cool paper for my linguistics class. And I have to write a new
personal statement, register and study for the GRE (I'm taking a
class, so that's good) and then fill out applications and do some of
the logistical stuff including getting transcripts and other
materials prepared for sending. I think my chances are pretty good,
though I can't bear thinking about what might happen if I don't get
in this time. So I'm not going to think about it.

7. Knit more. I still have a but load of sleeve knitting to do, and a
project that's progressing very slowly. It'll speed up in another 40
rounds or something. Sigh. My quota will be way down this year, I
fear.

That's all.

ok, question: do you italicize the title of a novella, or put it in
quotes. Does it depend on how it gets published or is there a rule of
thumb that I have forgotten? Literature majors everywhere answer now!
