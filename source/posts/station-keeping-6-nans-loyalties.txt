Messages from the Underground
-----------------------------

Nan rolled over for the third time in as many minutes, and tried to
ignore in incessant pinging from her communications panel. She was stuck
in that twilight space where her grasp of reality and the limits of
possibility were tenuous at best.

She relents finally and stands up and stumbles over to the comm panel
and activates it. The lights are low, but she's thankful when the video
system doesn't come on. While audio were historically uncommon, they
were not totally unfamiliar. "Hello?" she asked after a brief pause,
where she realized that it was probably expected that she confirm the
connection before the conversation.

Nan swayed a little as she stood, unsure of weather or not she should
try and pull herself fully awake or not. After a moment, she remembered
to say "Hello..."

"Ms. Gee, I can't tell you my name, but I'm with the Hanmist Resistance,
and--" came a cracking voice. Nan would have cut him off sooner had she
not been yawning.

"What do you want. It's the middle of the damn night up here." She
wasn't sure what time it was, or even if night was the right word to
describe the tim on the station. Hell, she didn't even know if this call
was legitimate: the voice wasn't any that she recognized. Her caller
knew more about her than she did him, if it was a him, and she wanted to
even that playing field as soon as possible.

"We know your work, and we we're building a network of supporters.
You're position on Hanm Centre will be very valuable to us when we
come."

"Come? I haven' manded. Nan thumbed up the lights and squared her
shoulders, in a hopes of sounding more authoritative.

"We support you, we support Hanm. We just want you to be ready for us
when we come..."

"*Oh come on, no one actually talks like that,*\ " Nan thought to
herself. "How will I get in touch with you?" She said, hoping that the
person on the other end couldn't hear her eyes rolling: it was probably
better to play along with this, even if it were a prank, but she didn't
have to like it. And hell, if there was a Hanmist movement around to
talk to her, this couldn't be a bad thing.

"You'll know. Do we have your support?"

"I support anything that's good for Hanm." Just ambiguous enough, and
true, ultimately she thought.

"Good, expect a package with more information soon. Hanm Will be free."
the words were uttered with a dispassionate murmur that sent a tremble
down Nan's spine.

"Ok, thank you." Nan responded politely before she cut the connection.
"Log last transmission and send the details to..." her command was
punctuated by a brisk entry of a code for her terminal in her office.
There was supposed to be a way for her to do this verbally, but she
always felt that it was easier and more secure to just enter the code by
hand. Nevertheless, Nan's instructions to the computer were curt, but
she was hopeful that she'd get back to sleep. She cut the lights and
stumbled back to bed.

Gift boxes from the Underground
-------------------------------

Nan almost tripped on a box as she walked into her office. "*How'd they
get that in here?*\ " She wondered.

She put her bag down next to her desk and walked carefully back to the
package. There was a blank piece of paper fastened to the top of the
box. She lifted it carefully, and on the back she read: "Nan: Hope these
help. Hanm will be free."

The memory of Nan's late night comm-call came rushing "I guess it wasn't
a fake or a dream," she muttered as she set the paper back on top of the
box. She sat down at the desk and called up the communications log.

Again Nan spoke to herself "What the hell am I supposed to do now?"
