I chickened out and wrote the last "scene," before the penultimate scene
which is giving me trouble. I'm pretty happy with it, but it might need
some tweaking so that it doesn't come off as too sentimental in the
ending.

I've got the files laid out for ten chapters, nixing my earlier,
"compress the last two chapters into one, because there isn't enough
material." At the moment, the ratio of scene lengths is looking like
4:2:\ *2*:1, (the italicized 2 is the part I haven't written, it might
come up looking like 3). With a total length of 4,500-5,000 words. All
the other chapters are a smidgen more than 3k. I'm leaning toward having
two chapters with a length ratio of say, 2:1 or 3:2.

While it's a hard scene on an emotional level, the larger issue is that
the embodiment of a couple of these characters is quite difficult to
write, and I think that I'm looking at what is necessarily a pretty
physical scene.

If I can get this damn monkey off my back. I think I have a date with a
sandwhich and my notebook. I think I'm going to try blockign the scene
out and then writing the dialogue, and see how that goes.

Cheers.
