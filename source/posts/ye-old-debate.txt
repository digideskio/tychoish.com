So there's a bill before the Missouri House at the moment, that attempts
to legislate creationsim. This goes beyond just trying to legislate
"morality" which is questionable enough, but this is actually trying to
legislate scientific fact. (Maybe they think if they make it law it'll
become true.) This follows the "if i stick my fingers in my ears and
sing, and stomp around, maybe it'll go away" method of lawmaking.

In any case, under duress I've compiled a group of resources for both
sides of this and I hope it helps someone. (As you may or may not know,
my sparse and occasional class notes for Theory of Knowledge get posted
to this site for your enjoyment. Or something.

A creation science resource page, and another, and another for good
measure

And the other side of the coin: One. Two. Three.
