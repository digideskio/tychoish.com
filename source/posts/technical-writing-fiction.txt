On `Outer Alliance Podcast
#8 <http://blog.outeralliance.org/archives/853>`__, `David
Levine <http://www.bentopress.com/sf/index.html>`__ talked about having
worked as a technical writer for some 15 years and then said something
to the effect of "It's a point of great personal pride that I've never
put a bulleted list in a piece of fiction."

I laughed out loud. Perhaps frightening a woman walking her dog nearby.

In most ways, the kind of writing that I do for work, API references,
tutorials, administration overviews, best-practice descriptions, is very
different from the kinds of things I write away from work, or at least I
like to think so.

The truth is that I've learned a bunch about writing and about
communicating in general from writing documentation. While my
"professional background," doesn't include formal technological
training, I definitely "broke in" because I was familiar with technology
and could write, rather than being a particularly skilled or trained
writer. Any more (just 2.5 years on,) I think the inverse is *more
true*, but that's conjecture.

Technical writing has definitely shaped the evolution of my taste: a
couple years ago, I found myself most drawn to complex tightly
constructed prose in fiction. These days I mostly go for sparse clear
concise prose that isn't particularly ornamented. Perhaps it's only
really possible to tune the internal editor for one kind of style at a
time.

Having said that, I will confess to feeling--and resisting--the urge to
put a bulleted list or some other structured convention of software
manuals in fiction.

It's the little things, really.
