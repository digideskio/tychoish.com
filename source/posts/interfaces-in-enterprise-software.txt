This post is a continuation of my [[human solution to IT and IT policy
issues\|cyborg/human-solution]] series. This post discusses a couple of
ideas about "enterprise" software, and its importance the kind of
overall analysis of technology that this posts (and others on this site)
engage in. In many ways this is a different angle on some of the same
questions addressed in my ":doc:`:Caring about Java </posts/caring-about-java>`"
post: boring technologies are important, if not outright interesting.

There are two likely truths about software that make sense upon
reflection, but are a bit weird when you think about it:

1. The majority of software is used by a small minority of users. This
   includes software that's written for and used by other software
   developers, infrastructure, and the applications which are written
   for "internal use." This includes various database, CRM,
   administrative tools, and other portals and tools that enterprise
   uses.

2. Beautiful and intuitive interfaces are only worth constructing if
   your software has a large prospective userbase *or* if you're writing
   software where a couple of competing products share a set of common
   features. Otherwise there's no real point to designing a really
   swanky user interface.

I'm pretty sure that these theories hold up pretty well, and are
reasonably logical. The following conclusions are, I think, particularly
interesting:

- People, even non-technical users, adjust to really horrible user
  interfaces that are non-intuitive all the time.

- We think that graphical user interfaces are required for
  technological intelligibility, while the people who design software
  use GUIs as minimally as possible, and for the vast majority of
  software the user interface is the weakest point.

  The obvious questions then, is: why don't we trust non-technical users
  with command lines? Thoughts?
