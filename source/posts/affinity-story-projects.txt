I'm kind of friends (as in I don't know her *that* well, but we've met
and talked at some length), with this girl who wrote a book called "My
Sisters' Voices: Teenage Girls of Color Speak Out."

Apparently Iris was reading a book that discussed the position and
perspective of teenage girls through a series of essays written by young
women, and while she liked it, it didn't really identify with her
struggle, as a young person of color. So she collected the essays for
that book and published it, and there it is.

Which got me thinking, you know, there really should be something in a
similar vein written by/about young gay men, or at least young male
identifying people who are a bit alienated from the
straight/narrow/binary world. On the one hand, it would be really easy
for guys to lie down and play the victim, and I would fear that a
project like this would come off as whiny, self centered, and overly
depressive. On the other hand, young men need to be empowered to break
out of the straight/narrow/binary system. I'd also be worried that it
would get too intellectual, because guys have a tendency to do that:
ntellectualize the position to the point of oblivion, and ignore or omit
the emotional overtones, which could really hurt the overall impact of
such a project.

What do you all think? Leave a comment, or drop me a line. Thanks!
