Heh.

Ok folks, so when I wrote that last post, I started out with the
intention of giving you a few links and send off a personal message in
response to a comment I got.

First off. I wanted to link to R. H. Lindsay Company, which is a wool
provider. This is great stuff. A friend just got an order and some of
the "Black hat Wool" and some of their other products. It's divine wool.
Really great for all you spinners and felters. I've you're interested in
spinning pre-dyed fibers than this is probably not for you, but there
are a limited natural colors. And the prices can't be beat.

As a spinner, while I like spinning yarn from dyed rovings every now and
then as a change of pace, I must say that I think natural colors are
really the best bet. I like naturals on princpal, 5 of the 6 sweater's
I'm currently knitting or have just knit, or plan to knit next, are some
combination of black gray and white. In terms of dye jobs, I think
kettle dyed yarns are really the best in the world, so it's useful to
dye after spinning and not before.

Check them out!

The second thing. Is that I want to publicly shame Ken for having not
seen the Star Trek movies. Geeze. I say, people these days. What's up
with that?

Cheers, Sam
