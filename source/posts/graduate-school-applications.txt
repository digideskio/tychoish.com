Graduate School Applications

I'm about 36 hours late blogging this, but I think it's something worth
declaring, both for the record keeping aspect, and because it's good to
make note of these things.

I'm done applying to graduate school. Finished. Complete.

Now the waiting begins. I've been guardedly optimistic.

A number of people who got really, rather amazing, Ph.Ds reported that
their application process, didn't compare to mine in scope and
brain-hours. They applied to a couple of top tier schools, got in to the
one they went, and thought little of it.

I on the other hand have been to the psychology pages (countless times)
of most large mid-western research schools, all of the
private-urban-research schools, and a smattering of canadian schools,
comparing and re-evaluating interests and lists, and potential faculty
advisors. Leading, to the creation of a fairly serious list, in August
of 2006 of ph.d. programs in personality and social psychology. Which
was all well and good, until I realized that given what I was really
interested in doing, I needed to find developmental psychology programs.

Ooops.

So I redid it, and made a new list, which I shortened a bit, and then
just applied.

Lord knows how it all went, an advisor seemed to think that I would get
in, and I think I'm probably one of the few graduates in my major at my
fine institution applying to research Ph.D. programs in this cycle. So
while I'm not declaring victory, or looking for an apartment in any
particular city (that's the guardedly part) I'm not sure about exactly
what happens if I don't get it. Nothing bad, just nothing specific.

But here's hoping in any case.
