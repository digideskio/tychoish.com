Hey everyone,

I hope this weekend finds you well. I'm still in the middle of the crazy
busy period of my life. I suppose this is it's way of finding balance. I
haven't written a journal post in a while so here goes...

1. I've been working a lot. Full time gainful employment, plus maybe as
much as 8 hours at the yarn store (teaching and regular work). Also
since there's a big morris dancing gathering *in a week* I've been
dancing one sort or another 4 times a week (Monday, Wednesday,
Friday, Sunday). It's both really invigorating and tiring, and I hope
that I can keep energy up.

2. I've applied for a job that would keep me here (not a bad thing,
particularly given the job) and I really want it, though I'm not sure
what my chances are. I've resolved to not pay much attention to job
searching for at least two more weeks and any academic thing other
than existing projects and possibly literature reading for at least
another month.

3. I'm pretty resolved at the moment to work on this new fiction
site/blog that I'm thinking about. I've begun sketching out plans,
organizational details, thinking about names, and of course, doing
some fiction writing. I'm sketching out a story set in a sort of
"rear frontier" colony world. It's sort of existential and dark and
space opera-y in a very tychoish way. It's going to be awesome, both
the site (which will have all sorts of stuff on it,) and the story.
I'm thinking about names and I have a good one, so with a little more
time in development, I'm excited. That's all.

4. Defiantly getting a new cat sometime the week after next. Maybe two.
Probably two, actually. Cats are cool. Kittens are really cool.

5. I've been knitting all of about a row and a half a day on the
sweater, it's coming along. Pictures soon for sure, but it's slow
going, and at this point in my life where I've been writing more, and
thinking about that, the knitting seems to take a back seat, which
isn't ideal, but it's something that needs to be addressed.

Keeping busy is a good thing, I'm convinced. I think at this very
instant, I'm a touch *too* busy, bit I know that this too will sort
itself out--as all things do--and I'll be in a good place.

Thanks for reading, and of course stay tuned.
