Wow.

Today just sort of happened, and I'm sort of glad that I was around to
realize it. I had thought that it was going to be a short and easy day,
and I was almost double booked a couple of times, but all seems to have
worked itself out. There would have been an afternoon post, but I didn't
have much of an afternoon to myself. These things happen.

I'm feeling better, which is kind of amazing. I might post more about
this tomorrow, but perhaps not. Onto a real post though,

Knitting on the shawl proceeds productively. I've done a little bit more
of the work on the beginnings of this shawl. While I'm not sure that
I've nailed what I did before *exactly* I'm damn near close enough. I
think. Also knitting on the shawl has allowed me to work on getting over
the "hump" of the sweater. [1]_

I think it has something to do with the fact that the shawl is *so
bright* that it makes the colors of the sweater appear more interesting
and subtle. Also, I think there's something about using bigger
needles/finer yarn which affects/improves my ergonomic situation.

Also as a side note, I'm posting this from `Mars
Edit <http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/>`__ which has gotten a make
over since the last time that I used it seriously. It's looking sharp.

Ok, you get to bed, I will too, and there'll be more interesting stuff
in the morning.

Onward and Upward!

.. [1] You know, that part of a sweater a few inches on either side of "half
   way to the underarms" from the bottom hem, always takes the longest.
