Latvian Dreaming Status 1

So we're in a sort of "long stretch" part of the Latvian-Dreaming
sweater. But I just wanted to post something to remind you that you can
start this any time and that I haven't forgotten about the project (it
is in fact, basically my own project at the moment).

So here's the plan:

1. The `project materials <http://www.lulu.com/content/2470929>`__ (PDF
chart, excel file with a more modifiable copy of the chart, a read me
file explaining how to read the chart) are located
`here <http://www.lulu.com/content/2470929>`__. Download them now!
2. Obtain yarn. Fingering weight to DK, in two colors. You'll probably
need a chunk more of the background/darker color. I'm bad at
predicting this. I got about 1425 yards of each color, but I had the
end of a skein leftover from a previous project of the background
color. I think this should be enough, and I anticipate significant
leftovers. This also depends a lot on factors like your gauge and any
resizing.
3. Determine your gauge and the number of stitches that you need to get
a sweater that you fits you. Hope that your number is close to 340.
If it's a bit smaller, don't sweat it, if it's a bit bigger, add a
couple of stitches at each underarm before stitch 1 on the chart. If
it's more or more than a few stitches less, (read
this](http://tychoish.com/rhizome/strategies-for-upsizing/).
4. If you want a ribbing cast on 320 and knit in two color ribbing for a
couple of inches, then knit a row in the background color and
increase to 340 `like
so <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/progress-and-increasing/>`__. And/or
adjust.
5. If you don't want a ribbing, or want to think about about it yet,
provisionally cast on 340 (or however many number of stitches you
need) and begin knitting the pattern in the next row.
6. Ignore anything I said previously about 344 stitches. My fault.
7. After you've increased, begin knitting the pattern, following the
chart, and the instructions for chart knitting included with the
chart. You'll be doing this for a long time.
8. Ask any questions you still have. (Before you ask about making a
cardigan, `read
this <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/cardigan-modifications/>`__.)
9. Keep knitting. Other than follow the chart, I'm not doing anything
until the sweater is 12 inches long. This is 3 inches from the
underarm point. I'll get to what happens here in an upcoming post.

Knit in good health!
