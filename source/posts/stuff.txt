still no news about grad school.

the longer I "stay in play," the better, probably, though I am looking
forward to this whole drama being over.

my dad said the other day, that "zebras don't need to run faster than
lions to stay alive, they just need to run faster than other zebras,"

which is both funny, and true. at any point, I could be the slow zebra,
but the chances are that there are slower zebras out there, and the
longer I'm in play, the better.

and it's funny. funny is good.

my spinning wheel came today. but I went for a kind of brisk walk after
being out and running around a lot today, and I'm just knackered. more
news on this forthcoming.

also, I got a new nalgen bottle and a a french press type thing for
making tea in it. I haven't quite mastered the insertion/removal thing
with grace but some day I will have it. I also got a couple more
varieties of black tea, including one with vanilla and thus I suspect to
have enough tea to get me through the beginning of 2009, unless I get
into graduate school, in which case, the end of october, max.

I think what you're witnessing is the live bloging of angst, and so I'm
going to go and do something else entirely.

love, tycho
