blowing up the neighborhood

as the firecrackers and other assorted explosive rain celebratorily down
on the neighborhood, I remembered that it's a holiday today. I'm off
work till next tuesday because of `knitting
camp <http://www.schoolhousepress.com/camp.htm>`__, so that's good
stuff. I have to drive 8 hour tomorrow, so I need to finish
packing/preping (well, arguably start packing/preping) before I do
tomorrows blogging.

I haven't yet decided where the knitting pictures should get posted. I
think I'm making the decision now to post knitting contnet (pictures,
reports from camp) here, on /tychoish. At least for the foreseable,
that's how it'll be.

ok, pack first, blog second.

cheers
