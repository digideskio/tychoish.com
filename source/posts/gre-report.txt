680 verbal 490 quant

Note: For H.'s benefit: one of my passages today mentioned Paula
Gunn Allen. No lie!

Also, as a note to myself, I have to pay 15 bucks to send the scores
to a certain northeastern former research powerhouse.

last time I got:

580 verbal 460 quant 6.0 writing

(I think).

Scores range from 200 to 400; except for the writing which is on a scale
of something to 6.0 (6.0 writing scores account for 5% of the sample.)
The percentiles are skewed against folk like me on the quant, because
(likely) more engineering students take the GRE than english majors. So
the quant section is comparatively harder, and equivalent scale scores
(so I think 500 verbal is a 50th Percentile, and 500 quant is a 30th
percentile.) FYI.

This isn't astoundingly wonderful, but it might not be incredibly bad
either. It might be good enough, which in these things is all that
matters. It's probably not worth worrying about overly much.

I don't think it's worth it to take it again, given that I couldn't take
it again soon enough to really matter this time around, and I don't
think that getting a higher quant score would help anything in a
theoretical 3rd cycle (which probably wouldn't be next year, but rather
2-3 years hence.)

Sigh. I'm officially going to take the rest of the day off, there will
be knitting, spinning, reading, perhaps writing, and some definite
television watching.
