knitting progress ahoy

I have knitting progress to report. In thee parts.

1. I have finished my second Pi shawl of the year. The first I completed
in March for my grandmother. The second, I completed a couple of
weeks ago, and while it was a shawl created without goal (or
particular purpose) it is an accomplishment of some note. I have yet
to block the shawl, but, as I'm not sure where it's supposed to end
up, I'm in no rush. It's also supremely huge, so I'm not sure I have
a good place to block it.

2. I finished my part of my contest entry for my knitting camp. Watch
out the rest of you camp-3ers, it's going to be massively awesome and
weird. Lots of weird.

3. This leads us to the most exciting knitting related conclusion I've
had to announce in quite a while: my works in progress list is *way*
down. I have two sweaters on the needles, a sock (no rush, plain
knitting, and a cobweb shawl which I don't have particular need or
inspiration to work on.) One of the sweaters just has one sleeve left
to go, and the other sweater, is almost to the armholes.

This is incredibly exciting. While I would like to get both of these
sweaters done by the time I go to camp (which will be a bit of a
stretch, it's not a requirement. My show-and-tell is something else
entirely.) I get to knit sweaters. I love knitting sweaters.

--------------

Pictures forthcoming, also the sweater with only a sleeve left to go is
indeed the "Latvian Dreaming" sweater which I started designing/working
on a year ago (or more). It's good to be closing in on that so I can get
the instructions up on the web. While I did have a big knitting hiatus
this year, and while I have been back knitting in some form for several
months now, I've felt more like I've been in "production" mode, rather
than "enjoyment" mode... until now.

So it's good to be back.
