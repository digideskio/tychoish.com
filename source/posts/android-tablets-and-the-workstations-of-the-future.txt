I've only had the tablet for a few weeks, but I'm pretty sure the tablet
incarnation of Android is probably 80% of what most users need in a
workstation. I'm not most users, but I figure: hook up a big screen and
a real keyboard. Create some key bindings to replace most of the
gestures, and write a few pieces of software to handle document
production, presentations, and spreadsheets in a slightly more robust
manner, and *you're basically there*. **I** wouldn't give up my laptop
today for a tablet, and I think the platforms still have a ways yet to
go, but that's not insurmountable.

Prediction: in the next decade, we'll see embeded tablet-like devices
begin to replace desktops computers for some classes of use and users.
General web surfing, reading, quick email, and watching videos on
YouTube seem like the obvious niche for now. I started to explore this
in ":doc:`Is Android the Future of Linux </rhizome/is-android-the-future-of-linux>`,"
but it's not abusrd to suggest that Android or iOS like devices might
begin to address more "general purpose desktop computing."

I want to be clear: we're not there yet. These systems aren't versatile
and fully featured enough to keep up with full time use on an extended
basis. This is mostly an application/software problem. As applications
evolve and as more functionality moves to remote systems anyway (this is
the "cloud," we've heard so much about,) tablet operating systems will
seem much more capable for general purpose work. Better
:doc:`mobile productivity </rhizome/mobile-productivity-challenges>` software will
help as well. Eventually, I think Android and similar platforms will
have a shot at the desktop market for most usage because:

- IT departments will get a lot more control over intra-organization
  information flow, which could save a lot of money for various IT
  categories: administration, support, and data protection costs.

- Behind the firewall dropbox-like services, and creating some sort of
  centralized workstation configuration management (which makes sense
  for a flash based device,) means backups can happen automatically,
  and if devices need to be re-imaged or are lost or damaged, it only
  takes a few minutes to get someone back to work after a technology
  failure.

- Limited multi-tasking ability will probably increase productivity.

- Disconnecting keyboards from the screen will probably lead to better
  ergonomic possibilities.

- Eventually, it will be easier to integrate Android-like devices with
  various workflow management/content management systems.

  The technology needs to mature and workers and IT departments need to
  become more comfortable with tablets, without question. Also, there are
  some fundamental developments in the technology that need to transpire
  before "desktop tablets" happen, including:

- More :doc:`power user-type interface features </rhizome/tablet-interfaces-and-intuition>`.

- Split screen operation. There are enough "common tasks" that require
  looking at two different pieces of information at the same time that
  I think tablets will eventually have to give up "full screen
  everywhere," operation. Conventional windowing is unnecessary, and I
  don't think anyone would go for that, but displaying two different
  and distinct pieces of information at once is essential.

- Better "Office" software for spreadsheets, presentations and document
  preparation. A necessary evil.

- Behind the firewall (preferably open source) solutions to replace
  services like Dropbox/Box.net and whatever other services emerge as
  essential parts of the "tablet/smartphone" stack.

- VPN clients and shared file system clients that are de ad simple to
  use. I think these are features for operating system vendors to
  develop.

Thoughts? Onward and upward!
