Perhaps Someday We'll Call This Deleuzian

I would say that *Anti-Oedipus* (may its authors forgive me) is a
book of ethics, the first book of ethics to be written in France in
quite a long time (perhaps that explains why its success was not
limited to a particular "readership:" being anti-oedipal has become
a life style, a way of thinking and living.) How does one keep from
being fascist, even (especially) when one believes oneself to be a
revolutionary militant? How do we rid our speech and our acts, our
hearts and our pleasures, of fascism? How do we ferret out this
fascism that is ingrained in our behavior? The Christan Moralists
sought out the traces of the Flesh lodged deep within the soul.
Deleuze and Guatteri, for their part, pursue the slightest traces of
fascism in the body.

-- Michel Foucault, writing in the preface to *Anti-Oedipus*, by Giles
Deleuze and Felix Guatteri.

I've spent a while away from Academia and geeky theoretical academic
thoughts for a while. Then I discovered `this twitter
account <http://twitter.com/DeleuzeGuattari>`__ and I got drawn back
into it. I read the tweets and I thought, "you know," these are
hilarious on their own because they are so off the well, but I think I
actually understand what's going on. I'd have conversations with
unsuspecting coworkers about little bits of Deleuzian theory. H.S. came
for a visit and we had a rather long conversation about Deleuze and
theory. I don't know that "I'm back," is exactly the right way to phrase
this, but I definitely enjoy the added perspective that I'm able to
bring to this stuff now.

I was never a very good theorist or philosopher, though I enjoy watching
from a far, I tend want answers to different kinds of questions. I'm
not, nor have I ever been "a scholar" of the "Capitalism and
Schizophrenia" diptych--I haven't even read it in its entirety--but it's
been a great influence me. Of the things that I read and interacted with
in college, I'd have to say that *Anti-Oedipus* and *A Thousand
Plateaus* are the texts that I return to with the greatest frequency.
And I never even took a class that assigned D&G!

I've read a fair number of papers and other pieces that have attempted
to use Deleuze's work as theoretical framework or some such, and I've
always been disappointed by what happens as a result. For starters, the
chance of Deleuze citations being: of the Rhizomatics essay at the
beginning of "A Thousand Plateaus," or from his collections of film
criticism are overwhelming. This is unsurprising as this probably
represents the most accessible of portions of Deleuze's work. Also
unsurprising is my sense that no matter what the paper is about, the
Deleuzian theory overpowers whatever the author is trying to say.
Deleuze's thought is pretty darn heavy, and there's no way around it.

And from some perspectives this is actually pretty funny: when you read
*Anti-Oedipus* it's not "fluffy," but it's pretty playful. There are
lots of metaphors and images that draw out the logic and the point.
There's a lot going on, but it's not *dense* (certainly not in the way
that Derrida is *dense*.) This has lead me to ask a two important
questions:

- If the writing is not very difficult or opaque, why do (Americans)
who attempt to *use* the work fail to capture the playfulness, and
seem too fall flat?

- Why am I (and clearly others as well) so intrigued by this work, and
why do I (we?) keep returning to this text? Particularly since it's
so difficult to use in support of other arguments.

The answers, I think bring us back to Foucault's assertion in the
preface, that *Anti-Oedipus* is (counter to first impressions) a book of
ethics rather than a book of cultural and social theory or even a
commentary on Marxist and Freudian theory. When reading the texts,
*Anti-Oedipus* (and *A Thousand Plateaus*) don't feel like ethical
manifestos, but I think that this explains why it's so difficult to
*use* and remains so intriguing.

That's enough for now, but I hope you'll pardon my impulse to blog about
Deleuze for a little longer, as I think there's another post or two
here.
