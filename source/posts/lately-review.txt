It's Friday and I have a bunch of links, notes, and accomplishments to
share.

First up, [[jfm]] and I have been continuing the [[discussion we had
about task lists\|rhizome/better-task-lists/discourse]] in a new
:doc:`:discussion </rhizome/mobile-productivity-challenges/discourse>` of the
:doc:`/posts/mobile-productivity-challenges`. I've also imported some
[[conversation from
facebook\|rhizome/cyborg-analysis-and-technology-policy/discourse]]
following up on the [[Cyborg Analysis and Technology
Policy\|rhizome/cyborg-analysis-and-technology-policy]] post that I made
this last week. I'm really *really* proud of the extent to which the
comments and edits that I've gotten have made my writing and thinking
clearer on these subjects.

Also, a thanks to the people who have done things like fix links and
correct stupid typos. Sorry to have caused the trouble, and I'm
eternally grateful for the helping hand.

Next up, I wrote a :doc:`:document </documentation>` for a reader who
commented in the [[Make Emacs
Better\|rhizome/make-emacs-better]]:doc:`:thread </rhizome/make-emacs-better/discourse>`.
The question addressed how to load optional functionality and
"contributed" lisp code in emacs, and I wrote [[a little tutorial on how
to load .el files in
emacs\|documentation/managing-emacs-configuraiton-and-lisp-systems]]. I
think of this as a very basic and straightforward piece of customizing
emacs; but it's sufficiently complicated and counter-intuitive enough
that I think a little bit of documentation is in order.

The above also marks the debut of a [[documentation]] section within the
wiki, like the [[code]] section, that I hope to update every now and
then as I write tutorials and reference material that I think someone
may be able to use. No promises, and feel free stash content here as
well. It's all gravy.

Speaking of the [[code]] section, I wrote a little script that I use as
``dbl``, that I describe in the :doc:`:Epistle Linker </code/epistle-linker>`.
Basically this little function goes through a directory and creates
symbolic links to that directory in a specified directory and mangles
the names of the file (prepends a few charters and changes the
extension.) :doc:`:Read the code </code/epistle-linker>`, but it makes it
possible to use a service like Dropbox without disrupting your local git
setup and file organization. There's a known issue with Dropbox that
makes it slightly less than ideal, but what can you do.

When I was posting [[code/epistle-linker]], I realized that I had
probably forgotten to mention the fact that I have this nifty little bit
of glue that uses a procmail filter (you *do* use procmail, don't you?)
to deposit note to a particular email address (configurable) into an
org-mode file for filtering. This is ideal for emailing your brain (i.e.
org-mode) an item from your phone or tablet, say.

And finally: I have an external link. I think this follows nicely from
the "how to work and 'live' in the mobile world." Apparently
`ecl <http://ecls.sourceforge.net/>`__, an embeded [[!wikipedia
Common\_Lisp]] implementation, has been built to run on
`Android <https://github.com/ageneau/ecl-android>`__ and
`iOS <https://github.com/kriyative/ecl-iphone-builder/tree/elf>`__. How
awesome is that?

That's all I have. I (finally) finished the April/May issue of Asimov's,
I subscribed to `Clarkesworld <http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/>`__, as
if I needed more short fiction to read and distract me from everything
else. been I've reading Iain M. Banks'
`Excision <http://www.amazon.com/Excession-Iain-Banks/dp/0553575376/>`__,
which has been a great deal of fun.

Other than that. It's been a pretty quiet couple of weeks.
