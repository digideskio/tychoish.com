Here's an entry where I dither on about the pros and cons of upgrading
the computer system.

Mostly it's kind of boring, except if you want to know what runs through
my head when ever I make a decision of any sort.

If that's the case, I pity you.

Pro
~~~

1. My computer is nearly 3 years old. In this time, apple has seriously
   revised the machines in nearly every possible way. Though most
   noticeably, the new processors substantially outperform the 1.67 G4
   that I have a the moment

2. My old computer isn't completely dead and will serve it's next owner
   pretty well.

3. I'm still using tiger, (10.4) and I'd have to spend $129 dollars to
   upgrade this computer to the new operating system, which I think I'm
   about due for. This isn't incredibly crucial... but if my computer
   were going to be useable in a long term, rather than short term way,
   I'd want leopard and a new battery (the current one gets $120). Even
   though I'm cheap, and probably wouldn't spend the 240, this is a
   further justification, but then that's what this list is about.

4. They just released new revisions today, and are unlikely to do so
   again till August or September. The computer I could order tomorrow,
   is the same as the one I could get for the next six months or so,
   likely at the same price. I don't know if I want to wait that long,
   in any case. If I get into graduate school, I don't think I want to
   be moving and upgrading in the same month (if I waited till the next
   release,) and if I don't, well, uncertainty.

5. There are some things that I've stopped using, or avoid using because
   they are painfully slow to use in the current configuration. They
   include quicksilver, bit torrent, media (photo/sound) editing. Also,
   I'm pretty quick to keep unused applications off, (My base stack is:
   Quicksilver, Adium, TextMate, Mail.app, Safari, NetNewsWire.
   Sometimes I have VLC or Preview open as well. That's it, and that
   works ok, but it's limited.)

6. The new computer wouldn't have a metal case and would therefore be
   better at picking up wireless signals. Grr. Ok, minor annoyance, and
   I have no problem picking up signals anywhere that I currently use
   the computer, but still, this is one of the many things that I'm
   looking forward to upgrading.

7. I'd be able to, with the new huge hard drive, be able to keep my
   music collection on my computer without crimping performance. By now,
   I have an 80+ gig iTunes Library, and a 100 gig hard drive. For a
   year, I've kept the iTunes library on an external hard drive.

Con
~~~

1. The old computer still works, and I really can't imagine that there's
   something new that I'd want to do with the computer that I couldn't
   do with the current computer. It might not be as

2. I plan to buy a second power cord this time around, but I have three
   that work with my current computer, so that's a step down in terms of
   features.

3. My income particularly given that I'm still waiting on The Word, is
   unsure. So spending 1300 dollars, given this, seems silly. The
   instant that I'm more sure, then this all makes a lot more sense.
   Making the order, now, without The Word, is probably not incredibly
   wise. At the same time, I've had the money for a new machine set
   aside for many months, incase there was some sort of sudden failure
   of the present computer. It is already in the budget for this summer,
   (see #4 above; this is probably the crux of my argument.)
