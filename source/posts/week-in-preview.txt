I watched the last episode of Battlestar Galatica, (I'd been behind
several weeks) today, because I was tired of everyone else talking about
it and staying away from reading things on the Internet because of it.
This is a story that I've been quite fond of for quite a long time, and
I was impressed with how well they wrapped it up. Really impressed. Good
work indeed.

I've also--and I haven't talked about this very much here, yet--been
writing more seriously on my projects than I have in a good long while.
It's good to be back, and I'm often surprised at how important writing
on my own projects (particularly fiction) is at keeping my spirits
afloat.

Now that the novel is on track again, I feel less overwhelmed at
knocking through other projects. My knitting is in better shape, I'm
blogging *better*, I worked on an academic project, and so forth.
There's still outstanding work, and I'm getting back into it, and that's
a good thing indeed.

I'm busy, as always, and there's too much to really go through it here,
but, but! I feel inspired rather than daunted at the prospect. I hope
you all have a good week as well.
