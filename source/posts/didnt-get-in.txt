I didn't get in to graduate school this time.

Feh.

I'm going to start putting out feelers for another try, but maybe not
next year I need a break from this applying thing, and I don't want to
be beating a dead horse or anything. And looking for (another) job. I'm
good income wise until the end of august, if need be, but I think it
would be good to find something solid and suited that I could do while I
retool.

Also, this research project that I've been working on this semester is
something that I could continue to work on for a while, and something
that I think could easily lead to me into interesting next steps.

It's good to keep busy and this helps, but the truth is that this sucks
royally. Just saying.

But there are worse things in the world than working and focusing on
writing and knitting and spinning, and I look forward to sharing those
moments and experiences with you here. And also sharing other things
here because *really* those sorts of thoughts are much more interesting
for *both* of us than the endless introspection.

Be in touch would you? I will be too.
