This is from a collection of "laws" from `Larry
Niven <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niven%27s_laws#Others>`__

If you've nothing to say, say it any way you like. Stylistic
innovations, contorted story lines or none, exotic or genderless
pronouns, internal inconsistencies, the recipe for preparing your
lover as a cannibal banquet: feel free. If what you have to say is
important and/or difficult to follow, use the simplest language
possible. If the reader doesn't get it then, let it not be your
fault.

I like it, so I copy it here. I also think that this sums up one of the
chief reasons that I didn't major in writing in college. Just saying.
Sorry H.
