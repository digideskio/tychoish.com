It's finally, I think, getting cold for real here which is nice. I can
wear sweaters again, for real, mostly.

The new yarn store has its grand opening today, and although we were
open yesterday, it's for real today. That'll be exciting. I got a/the
copy of *Sweaters from Camp*, and I quite like the book, and always
have, so it's time that I actually got it. I think it might solve my
indecision regarding my next big project.

My intention to get up early and write was foiled by chores and whatnot,
but that's ok, I guess, I'll be thinking about things today, and maybe I
can take some notes, during off moments, to counteract the certain "omg
I can't think about words now," feeling that I get after a long day.

There was sweater blocking last night, and though I'm not wearing it
today, I will have it with me and I suspect there will be pictures.

Also, there's been a problem with the RSS feed for a few days, so if
you're used to reading the site by RSS (one way or another) then you may
have missed a few posts. I think it's all fixed now. I'm still not sure
about the `TealArt <http://tychoish.com/>`__ home page, but there's no
time to worry about that now.

Have a great day, I'll report back in a bit!
