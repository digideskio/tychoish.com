hello!

I've had a pretty good weekend I think. There's a knitting group this
afternoon, and I now have the missing needle that I've needed for a
while to continue with my knitting progress on a sweater that I put
aside a few weeks ago. THe new sweater might need an afterthought hem
but that can happen later of course. Also, on the schedule for today is
a trip out to get a tea pot. How cool is that?

Other newsbits:

- I've completed a series of tealart posts that I'm going to start
  airing this week or maybe next week. It outlines a cool project that
  I might be able to start later this year or early next year,
  depending on what energy I get behind it. Knitting related. I've had
  a lot of fun

- I finished chapter two of the novella. I have a good outline for
  chapter 3. Chapter 2's pacing is a bit slower than I intended, and I
  was worried that I didn't get enough story done in it, despite the
  fact that it was jammed full of stuff that needed to be there. Then
  I did the outline for chapter 3, and it came out perfect. I'm still
  on track. It's still early, of course, but this writing experience
  has felt very much like everything is "clicking into place." That's
  a good thing.

- I culled a lot of my RSS reading, to 121 feeds. At the beginning of
  the summer I had nearly 500 feeds (many of them had stopped
  updating, stiil) every time I would hit refresh (per week) I would
  get ~1200 new items. I got down to about 250. Which meant that I
  refreshed a couple of times a week, but still had about 400 items to
  read each time, even if I was pretty regular about it. This new low,
  cuts out a lot of the things that I wasn't actively reading, but
  wanted to "keep an eye on." It's hard to be a digital pack rat
  sometimes. It's my hope that with fewer things to read, I'll be able
  to think of the internet reading that I do as participation in a
  community, rather than the mass absorption of information. It might
  also mean that I could start to experiment with other news-reading
  software, that I've wanted to try out, but haven't had the freedom
  to really use in a long time.) Vienna, google reader, etc.

This progress also means that I have some more/new tasks to complete, in
addition to all the things that are lingering around:

- While I have *almost* two weeks worth of TealArt posts prepped and
  ready to go, I don't have two consecutive weeks of posts ready, so I
  need to write a few different kinds of posts for this week, to make
  everything jive right.

- I need to get a start on chapter three of the novella, so that I have
  something easy to pick up on next week. having at least 500 words and
  possibly more, would be great, because I'm not going to get much
  fiction-writing time this week or next.

- Do school stuff.

That's all for now. We'll be in touch of course.
