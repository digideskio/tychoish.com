`Judy wrote a post
today <http://metallumai.livejournal.com/127701.html>`__ about identity
and how we change ourselves to fit what we're doing at any particular
moment. I've been thinking about something reasonably similar for a few
days and I've meant to write about it more extensively and clearly here.
So I'm going to now. At the moment my interest is pretty specifically
focused on how the act of naming serves to concretize identity and
meaning, basically "what's in a name," to be overly trite.

By giving something a name, we make it seem comprehensible as something
unique, and there's an expectation that people can understand what
something is going to be based on the name. If I give you the title of
this blog (and your familiar with the site) you're probably going to
know what the posts are going to be like--and mostly you'd be right.
Just as, if I told you that a site is a "blog" you know (or think you
know) something about it's organization and layout.

I think the theorists would say that "naming is performative," but I
think the invocation of J.L. Austen is *totally unnecessary*, and
probably pretty confusing in the long run. Basically this means that the
act of attaching a name to something is as a result of its utterance,
meaningful. At the same time, a little sign-posting doesn't seem
uncalled for.

On some level, that's what the term "queer" is about (trying to
establish a different way of thinking about sexual and gendered
difference) and because of this and because of the importance of
performativity to "queer" that I consider naming to be a queer issue.

So why am I writing this, you wonder? In part because I feel like this
blog needs a new name, and in part because I'm considering my pen name
more thoroughly as I embark more seriously upon a knitting career.

First, the blog: The current name "the life and opinions of tycho
garen," is a bit stale, and I think provokes a style of blogging that's
more like a journal, a style that I've been fully complicit in enacting.
And while I do take pleasure in the allusion to Lawrence Stern's *The
Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman,* I'm not sure that my
karma needs that kind of spiritual connection at the moment. I'd also
like to push this site back in the direction of the blog over the
journal.

I used names for TealArt (r.i.p.) that were reminiscent of newspaper
titles (e.g. "The Times of TealArt"), but I think I need something
different. This blog/site will still be called *tychoish*, but I think
some better title is much needed and I'm looking for suggestions.

Maybe I should see if I could cycle through a list of titles (for up at
the top), there are a number that I think might work well. Maybe what
I'm looking for is more of a tag line. Things that have been floating
through my mind:

-  *innovative bordering on the avante garde* (from torchwood, Ianto's
reference to Jack's sexual prowess.)
-  *awkward, but endearingly colloquial* (An actual comment a prof.
wrote on a paper, a long running joke, and I used it on TealArt for a
long time. perhaps too journal-ish)
-  *tychoish from the past future* (I like phrases that mash up "future"
and "past" because they create a sense of history.)
-  *work and live as if--* (the less famous first half of the Alisdar
Gray quote that ends "--you live in the early days of a better
nation," which Ken MacLeod has already used for a blog title)

That's all I have for right now, suggestions are welcome.

Now on to the more serious part: the name.

To which I guess I don't have a lot to say, except that I'm not sure.
Here's some pro/con analysis, but I hope you give suggestions.

**Pros to using pen name *tycho garen*:**

-  The name is entirely my own. I chose it, I have shaped it myself,
without connection or reliance on other people. There is no "garen
family" tradition, nothing. Just me.
-  It's what this blog has always and will continue to be authored under
(even if TealArt was originally authored by my given name). There's a
marketing advantage here.
-  Pseudonyms paradoxically draw attention to the identity and role of
the author, in a way that is rather cool.
-  It's more difficult to mispronounce than my given last name. The
silent H is a bit of a blip, but I have an 8 letter last name that's
typographically complex (-nm- letter pair,) and an english spelling
anomaly (-ei- sequence.)
-  "garen," is a loose homage to my maternal grandfather (his first name
began with G, and in the tradition of jewish naming, that and
intention are enough), which feels nice.
-  I feel more comfortable being a non-capitalizer with a pseudonym
-  It allows me to isolate my professional (academic or otherwise)
production from everything else, and offer some differentiation for
the purpose of google.

**Cons to using pen name *tycho garen*:**

-  I think it would be difficult to change later if I had second
thoughts.
-  Might be more difficult to use it to do business.
-  In this vein it might cause confusion, which is bad from a marketing
perspective.
-  Many people know me by the given name, as they should, particularly
in the context of knitting (knitting camp, various other things.)
-  It is hard to mix it up, to do some things with one name and some
things with other names.
-  I debate weather it's the same or different as writing under a
modified version of their given names: JMS goes by Joe but is
credited J. Michael Strazinsky, `J. C. "Chris"
Hutchins <http://twitter.com/jchutchins>`__ and so forth.
-  tycho is less (potentially) ambiguously gendered than "Sam," and
significantly less common, though Sam is a pretty uncommon for men in
my generation.

I'm thinking I'm going to go with it for the publishing (to the fam, I
**don't** want to change my name or anything, just a pen name, to be
clear), but I don't know. I suspect I'll get it sorted out.

Any feedback you can offer with regards to either the name of the blog
or the pen name debacle, I'd love to hear from you a lot.

Cheers, tycho

(ps. Onward and Upward!)
