Backwards Socks

So here's this really cool sock pattern. A lot of people have been
working on this sock which for the initiated uses a traditional sock
heel worked backwards. This backwards sock, uses a normal heel flap
owkred in the opposite direction, and really there's no reason to think
that this wouldn't work, and I think is incredibly clever. I think I
know what my next sock is going to be.

Ha!
