Better Living Through Regular Expressions: Links/Resources

So rather than post something witty about regular expressions with our
friends **G** and **H**, I'm going to post some links that I've gathered
about regular expressions and sed. First up, regular expression
resources:

- `One Regular Expreson
  Tutorial <http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xbd/re.html>`__
- `Another Regexp Guide <http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Regular.html>`__
- `Microsoft's Discussion of
  Anchors <http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/13bs2wz9(vs.80).aspx>`__
- `RegExp
  Tutorial <http://www.regular-expressions.info/anchors.html>`__ -
  Regex Tutorials
- `GREP In Project for Text
  Mate <http://henrik.nyh.se/2007/06/grep-in-project-command-for-textmate>`__

I'd like to make special note of this final item. GREP in Project
command for TextMate. It's awesome, and uses GREP, a great *fast*
command line tool for Unix to search projects (and files as well) in
TextMate. And it's pretty. You can't argue with that.

This is *almost* a good transition into another bunch of links that I've
collected on sed. Sed, (**S**\ tream **Ed**\ itor), is sort of a text
editor with out an interface, and lets you basically use regular
expressions to do find and replaces from the command line. Pretty
awesome if you ask me. Anyway, read and learn.
