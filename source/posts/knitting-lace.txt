On Knitting Lace

When I packed to come live with my grandmother for an extended stay, I
didn't give a lot of thought to my knitting. I packed some, the usual
ongoing projects and whatever yarn was attached to them, and that was
about it. I'm at a point in all of my knitting where I've made serious
progress (but haven't completed) on a number (2? 3? big projects). My
hope, by not packing too much yarn, was that I would be able to make
some serious progress on all of my projects without being tempted by the
sweater (which is my wont).

So I've been knitting a lot of lace: it travels well, the yarn goes a
long way, and it can be seriously relaxing. And lace is complex enough
to keep the brain satisfied, while still being easy to not wear out the
braincells.

But the projects are big, so I'm prone to thinking "why the hell am I
doing this," perhaps a bit more than I should. I don't wear lace, while
I know a few people who like to wear lace, (even among women,) I've
found that a lot of people don't particularly like lace.

So the question is: why knit lace? Particularly if you don't like to
wear it.
