As a teaser, of sorts, here's the first paragraph of this version of the
`novella I'm working
on <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/novella-progress/>`__.

Sorry, It's encoded, but it's breakable, and there *should* be enough
clues around you should be able to figure it out. I'm mostly doing this
for fun.
