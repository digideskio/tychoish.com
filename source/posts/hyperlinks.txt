Though short, this week has been pretty good. I've been doing cool
things at work, I've been writing and posting blog entries, *and*
fiction(!), I'm on top of email, and the sweater is growing. I hope this
isn't just a fluke and that I can keep this up and also expand slightly
into doing a bit more reading. Small steps.

I've done a little bit of work on the wiki and site. Notably, selected
entries are mirrored on `Planet Emacsen <http://planet.emacsen.org>`__.
Also consider the following links to updates on the wiki and other
sites:

- [[Discussion of "Make Emacs
  Better"\|rhizome/make-emacs-better/discourse]], which has been
  incredibly productive and an interesting discussion of emacs adoption
  and use by non-programmer niches. I think this discussion and the
  :doc:`:original post </rhizome/make-emacs-better>` connect pretty well with
  a post that made the rounds a few weeks ago: `Lets Just Use
  Emacs <http://beastwithin.org/users/wwwwolf/fantasy/avarthrel/blog/2011/05/lets-just-use-emacs.html>`__

- :doc:`:Cyborg History </cyborg/history>` - a link from my father on the
  history of computing. I replied to him with `Code Quarterly Interview
  with Hal Abelson <http://www.codequarterly.com/2011/hal-abelson/>`__.

- I've also collected a few :doc:`:LaTeX System links </latex-system/links>`,
  of related projects, ideas and collaborators. I've also had a few
  conversations that I need to transcribe into the wiki. Watch this
  space.

- Then there's
  `emacs-instapaper <https://bitbucket.org/jfm/emacs-instapaper/src/6b135e2a6f91/instapaper.el>`__,
  which isn't exactly a FaiF web service, but the functionality is
  great for the subway, and I like being able to keep Firefox closed
  more of the time.

That's all for now!
