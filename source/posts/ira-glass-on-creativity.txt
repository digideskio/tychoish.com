So this video popped up a couple of times in my news reader today, and I
think it's good enough to repost with some additional comments. It's a
video with Ira Glass talking about how creative people who are getting
started doing something now need to give themselves permission to make
crap *and* that the most important thing is to *keep doing it,* because
the only way to learn is to make a lot of crap.

This has become a virtual mantra for me, and I think it's good to have
people remind us of this from time to time. This is why I'm starting a
fiction blog. That's why I write blog entries every day.

I think it's true of knitting, as well. I have scores of horrible
sweaters, and while most of my sweaters work now (and the ones that
don't are ill conceived from the beginning,) that's a technical skill
that I worked pretty hard for. So I'd say, not only does Ira Glass have
it correct [1]_ for things like writing and audio/video production, but
I think that he succeeded in expressing it in a way that's applicable to
*everyone* that makes something.

--------------

Today I edited the first sequence of the novella I wrote nearly a year
ago. While I've been dreading this for a long time, I think it went off
really well. I added a line that a test reader (whose unfamiliar with
the work) really liked, I tweaked some things in a way that tie this
scene (which I went back and added later) into the story more closely.

I made this one sequence better in fairly concrete ways, and I think
every previous time that I'd tried to do this before I hadn't been good
enough to make it better. But a year later, I am enough better than I
was that I was able to do this one thing better. I don't think I've
"made it" or anything, but it's nice to have some sort of verification
of improvement.

This scene that I talk about will be part of `critical
futures <http://criticalfutures.com/>`__ at some early point in that
sites' development. Maybe a week from today?

Stay tuned.

I've sort of been thinking about this as a maxim of "success on the
internet," because I think it's particularly true from an
online/independent business perspective, given that online ventures
have trivial costs, aside from "time making crap." But I think the
video makes the point that this is true in all sorts of contexts
where creative proficiency is the goal. So then, it's more a maxim of
"success in creativity."
