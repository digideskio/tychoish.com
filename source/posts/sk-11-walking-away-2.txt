   INT. ANOTHER ROUND, a booth in the far corner.

   They both sip from their drinks leisurely. DAVID reclines and keeps a
   gentle hand on his bottle at all times, ELI sits up straight and only
   picks up his bottle occasionally.

   So, have you heard anything?

   Um? Anything? I'm not in your intelligence department, I am actually
   retired. I think I've done my bit--

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   <dd>

   People like you don't retire, the Navy wouldn't allow it. You have the
   only real social space on the station, you have to hear things.

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   <dd>

   We only don't retire when you don't want us to. From what I've seen you
   have a great staff, and that Sian is a great officer.

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   ELI BANNER

   <dd>

   He is, you're right, but don't distract me. You should have my job now,
   and we both know it.

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   DAVID CONRAD

   <dd>

   Weren't we decided that this is a shit assignment for you. You'd have
   been an admiral otherwise. Didn't Admiral Roth apologize for sending you
   out here.

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   ELI BANNER

   </dt>
   <dd>

   You're here, how bad can it be? And besi--

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   DAVID CONRAD

   </dt>
   <dd>

   Irrelevant argument. I'm not an officer any more, and it's an
   interesting place for Marc to practice, and for me to be retired.

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   ELI BANNER

   </dt>
   <dd>

   --besides, this is the most high-profile post in the entire League. I'm
   surprised Roth didn't take it for himself.

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   <dd>

   He probably wanted to, but one of his cronies probably convinced him
   that it was better to wait out another thousand years in
   interstellar-transit. He probably thinks that that'll give him a better
   chance at the top...

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   ELI BANNER

   </dt>
   <dd>

   He's been around that long? No wonder.

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   DAVID CONRAD

   </dt>
   <dd>

   Really, I know.

   </dd></dl>

   <p>

   DAVID takes a drink.

   </p>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   ELI BANNER

   </dt>
   <dd>

   He'd be a fool not to realize that that's a bad move. By that time,
   he'll be a relic--

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   DAVID CONRAD

   </dt>
   <dd>

   Already is. But at least someone who has his ear has our best interests
   at heart.

   </dd></dl>

   <p>

   DAVID chuckles.

   <dl><dt class="character">

   You? You did it?

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   <dd>

   I'd rather you have a chance at the top than Roth.

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   <dd>

   Bastard.

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   </dt>
   <dd>

   You're welcome. If you ever want to be an Admiral, though...

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   ELI BANNER

   </dt>
   <dd>

   I hate you. For this, you better start working for me.

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   DAVID CONRAD

   </dt>
   <dd>

   Not on your life. You really are the best person for this job. Better
   than I would be.

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   ELI BANNER

   </dt>
   <dd>

   Wait, if you're still in, why not just do the job yourself. You could.

   </dd></dl>

   <p>

   ELI finishes his drink.

   <dd>

   Because it's yours, I've had my fun being in charge and... out front.
   I'm done with that. I promise you. You're right, the Navy won't really
   let me go completely, but if they listen to me when I talk, I'll take
   it. Out here, I'm in no danger of being called to lecture and teach
   constantly,

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   ELI BANNER

   </dt>
   <dd>

   So I guess that leaves me--

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   DAVID CONRAD

   </dt>
   <dd>

   --with a good bar and very capable backup. Speaking of the bar...

   </dd></dl>

   <p>

   DAVID finishes the rest of his drink.

   </p>

   <dd>

   Thank you for the drink, now trust me, it there's something that you
   need to know I'll tell you, otherwise...

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   ELI BANNER

   </dt>
   <dd>

   Leave you alone?

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   DAVID CONRAD

   </dt>
   <dd>

   --don't try and conscript me. Again.

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   ELI BANNER

   </dt>
   <dd>

   Ok... I guess.

   </dd>
   <dd class="parenthetical">

   (sly smile)

   </dd>
   <dd>

   I'll keep you in the loop.

   </dd></dl>

   <p>

   DAVID and ELI stand up.

   </p>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   DAVID CONRAD

   </dt>
   <dd>

   Please don't.

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   ELI BANNER

   </dt>
   <dd>

   I have to.

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   DAVID CONRAD

   </dt>
   <dd>

   I won't read it.

   </dd></dl>

   <dl><dt class="character">

   ELI BANNER

   </dt>
   <dd>

   Whatever, you will read it.

   </dd></dl>

   <p>

   DAVID laughs knowing that ELI is probably right about this point. DAVID
   pulls ELI into a quick friendly hug.

   I think you should get out now and get some sleep for your next
   shift--when ever you decide that is--or it'll be my turn to hate you.

   ELI turns and leaves. DAVID watches and we
