Big Fish, Small Fish: RSS feeds
===============================

As I've progressed through my recent culling of feeds. (I used to
subscribe to almost 500 RSS feeds, now I'm down to about 75, after
getting bellow 50). I've been thinking about the kinds of blogs that I
read regularly, and that I'm interested in expending time reading.

Seems to me that the crux of this argument boils down to:

- read the a-list and professional publications because this is the way
  to "stay on top of the news," in a quick and efficient sort of way.

- avoid reading a list blogs and sites because you're more likely to
  find new/interesting/unique reading, (and more of it) if you're not
  busy keeping up to date with BoingBoing and slashdot, say.

I'm going to post a copy of my OPML file (that is the export file from
my news reader, that you can import to any news-reader around,) so you
can see what I'm reading. I recommend all these sites. `Here it
is <http://tychoish.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/tychoish_subscriptionsopml.zip>`__.
It's zipped, and it doesn't include this `site's
feed <http://tychoish.com/feed/>`__, to which you should of course
subscribe. The organization of the list is somewhat idiosyncratic,
admittedly.

I think this pondering this in part with the launch of
`io9 <http://io9.com>`__. On the one hand I really like the concept, I
think conceptually Gawker is a force of good, and the posts are
good. [1]_ On the other, it doesn't feel very *of the people.*

And clearly I go back and forth on this a lot. I read BoingBoing more or
less, and I have typically listened to `TWiT
podcasts <http://twit.tv/>`__. So who knows. I don't have an answer
here.

.. [1] Though it's quite true that while I enjoy reading SF and watching SF
   drama, and writing said, and I am a huge geek in my own way, I'm not
   typically a very good *Science Fiction Fan.* Not that I have a
   problem with this, but in a lot of ways io9 isn't my type of site, I
   guess, which isn't bad, it just is.
