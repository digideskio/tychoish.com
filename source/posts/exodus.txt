Exodus

One of the ideas that I'm playing around with in the new project is an
"exodus from Earth," where our people will be through the course of the
long [1]_ story, will be leaving earth and our solar system for more
hospitable places.

This ties in with some of the ideas that I was playing with in the last
post, in that I think this presents an interesting perspective to talk
about some cool issues, even if I don't think it's particularly likely
that there's going to be a human exodus from our solar system in the
next 500 years.

Also, I think it creates a space where I can take a couple of core
cyberpunk ideas and get away writing a lot of very cyberpunk-ish things
that if I were writing them straight on, I don't think I could get away
with. If I was writing a story set in the present/near future that had
the sort of bleak settings and *hypertechnologized* environments, I
don't think it would fly, but in the context of an exodus from this
solar system? It makes more sense. At least to me, and I'm the one who
matters at this point.

That's all for now. I should point out that I've finally made the
transition to life as an IMAP mail user, and will hopefully now be less
tethered to my specific instance of computer. We shall see...

Cheers, sam

.. [1] I'm using the term "long" in the same sense as the "long 18th
   century," rather than the sense that implies the story will be a
   lengthy narrative. It covers a lot of ground, but needn't take a lot
   of time if done correctly.
