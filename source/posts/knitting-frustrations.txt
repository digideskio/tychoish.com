knitting frustrations

I remember at times like this, why I don't often have more than one
serious knitting projects: you never have the feeling that you're
getting anything done, and you never feel like you're any closer to
starting something new.

Now, to be fair, I never simply have one project. There's always one or
two pairs of socks in my sock bag which I work on when the mood strikes
me. I'd say, I probably finish 4 pairs of socks a year, give or take a
few, but I don't work on them very much. I also have the grey sweater,
that I've been working on for years, but it has a lot of plain knitting,
and it's very fine gauge. Last summer I only knit on it at movies, and
in the last school year, I probably knit, a total of like 4 inches: but
I expect it of this project. But in addition to this miscellany, I have
one, and only one project.

Almost always this project is a sweater, usually a 2 color sweater.

At the moment. In addition to the usual score of projects I listed
above, I have 2 sweaters (ie. 3 sleeves), and extra socks in progress,
and it's driving me batty. Some of the socks are for my class so I need
to get those done, and the other sweaters are close, but it's hard to
work on all of them because it divides your attention. While I have
thrown one on the back burner for the present moment because of a
somewhat intentional needle shortage, it still nags.

Sigh.
