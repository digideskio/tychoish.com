A mostly technology-centric collection of links:

- **Emacs starter configuration scripts.** I can't, for the life of me,
recall why I went looking for this, but last week I ended up with a
whole host of basic configuration files that people have published.
I've thought about doing this for my own files, but I've not had it
properly cleaned up *and* working in a non-embarrassing way in a
while. Most of these are on `github <http://www.github.com/>`__,
which is a phenomena that could tolerate some investigation, but no
matter. Here they are, linked to by screen name:
`ki <http://github.com/ki/my-dot-emacs/>`__,
`elq <http://github.com/elq/dot-emacs/>`__,
`jonshea <http://github.com/jonshea/config-files/blob/master/.emacs>`__,
`larrywright <http://github.com/larrywright/emacs>`__,
`defmacro <http://sources.defmacro.org/emacs-conf/>`__ (har, just got
it), `jmhodges <http://github.com/jmhodges/emacs-starter-kit>`__,
`technomancy <http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit>`__,
`markhepburn <http://github.com/markhepburn/dotemacs>`__, and
`al3x <http://github.com/al3x/emacs/tree/master/vendor/>`__. I'd love
to collect more of these, so maybe comments or `the cyborg
wiki <http;//www.cyborg%20institute.com/wiki/>`__.

- **Adjunct to that, a few more cool emacs and related links and
points:** First, `paraedit which is a little tool which makes editing
lisp
easier <http://trey-jackson.blogspot.com/2009/09/emacs-tip-33-paredit.html>`__,
as well as an `org-mode <http://www.orgmode.org>`__ tip from `Nathan
Yergler <http://www.yergler.net>`__ `about using org-rembmember with
firefox and
ubiquity <http://yergler.net/blog/2009/10/07/remembering-with-org-mode-and-ubiquity/>`__.
which might be of interest to some of you. I also have in the file
[this link about yet another lisp dialect (yald?) called
`Lysp <http://www.piumarta.com/software/lysp/>`__, but I don't have
much more than that. I, on the other hand `will have more to say
about this in the coming few
weeks <http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm/>`__.

- `My **friend Chris Fletcher discusses his experience with
contemporary blogging services** in this
post <http://mbranesf.livejournal.com/10392.html>`__. I'm not sure.
Right? I mean blogging is so different today than it was when I got
into it. I remember when you handed FTP credentials to blogger so
they could publish your blog with their system to your site. Surely
people don't do that anymore. One of the things that I noticed at
Podcamp (more on that on another post) that, frankly horrified me a
bit, was that there was a whole class of bloggers who wanted to do
"this thing," but they had no interest in running their own website
or making that investment of time and energy.

And maybe that's what blogging has become. In a lot of ways *doing a
blog* is something anyone can do pretty easily, and having a website is
no longer a big part of participating in this discourse. While I'm a big
fan of independence, and I don't think the technological burden is that
high. "Doing websites," very much made me the geek I am today, so I'm
not sure. Having said that, LiveJournal has never easily fit into a
niche: It was blogging before there was blogging. It was social
networking before we said that. It was subculture/niche before that
became the thing. If I had more time in my life I'd figure out some way
to study and capture that history.

- For all of you **OS X Desktop User Interaction Geeks**, `there's this
thing that lets you hide unused
windows <http://db.tidbits.com/article/10624>`__ baked into the
window manager. I think. I have access to OS X, but I don't really
use it enough to give this a try. GNU Screen and lots (and lots) of
Emacs buffers make it possible to keep a lot of irons on the fire
without getting distracted.

- `A **good example of a zshrc**
file <http://blog.edwards-research.com/2009/10/my-zshrc/>`__ if
that's your thing. I think it's my thing. Alas. I'll write more about
this once I get more used to it and figure some things out. Mostly,
I'm finding that one can use it as a pure superset of bash without
ill effect.
