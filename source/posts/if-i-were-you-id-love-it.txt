I was looking around for websites to link to/discuss, on the new
'everyone has a story' section of tealart, when I came across
subjuntivistis, a website for the preservation and acknowledgment of
subjective tense in the english language. It's clever, and I think it's
pretty well written. Once I have time to peel through some stuff, I'm
sure I'll find more good content to link to, but for now, I just wanted
to submit it for your enjoyment.
