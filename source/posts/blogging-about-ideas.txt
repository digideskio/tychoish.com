Blogging about Ideas
====================

This is the first post I've written in a long time that wasn't about
open source/technology stuff. Not that I'm not still fascinating (or
cranking out blog entries about that,) but it's fun to tred on other
ground for a while. This post grows out of some very abstract thinking
I've been doing inrelation work about the nature of blogging.

First off there's the divide between journaling and blogging. Though the
distinction is pretty clear cut, in practice the lines blur. Journaling
include posts/blogs that recount your own experiences and events, more
or less as they happen. Blogging in contrast are posts that explore
ideas and events around the author(s) expereince. And blogs are
chronological so they look like journals and sometimes include "personal
notes" posts, while journals will sometimes/often include the authors
thoughts on a subject outside of the authors experience. So it's a muddy
playing field from the get go, but I think it's useful to think about
what makes a successful blog, because it's more of what I have been
doing here , and it may be easier\ *er* to quantify than what makes an
successful journal.

I'd like to put out 4 *general* theories for your consideration about
"blogging that works:" [1]_

1. Posts should generally explore ideas, concepts, events, and other
   texts. But mostly ideas.

2. Posts should explore *one* idea/concept, and only *one* idea/concept.
   If you want to write more complex essays, figure out a way to write
   articles for a more tratditionally formated publication (such things
   exist on the web).

3. Blogs are highly referential texts. Blogs which don't include links
   to other blogs, and/or don't include quoted text I think miss some of
   the point of what makes the web so great.

4. Blog posts need to be short. (Guilty as charged!) Blogs are meant to
   be read in concert with other blogs, and time is
   `scarce <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/on-scarcity/>`__. Also attention
   is scarce. And really if you're only talking about one idea, getting
   it into ~400 words is hard, but it's something to aim for.

That's what I have. Any ideas on your end? Speaking of under 400 words,
I'll be done now, with none to spare!

.. [1] In some perverse way I guess this is a "X tips for Better Blogging"
   post, but I don't care if you `digg <http://www.digg.com/>`__ it or
   not.
