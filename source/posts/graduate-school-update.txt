I just received an acceptance from San Francisco State University's MA
program in Human Sexuality Studies. I have to file for financial aid
still, so I don't know how that's going to work.

This means, I'm pretty sure, that I'm going to be in school next year.

I'm still waiting to hear from five other programs, three of which were
in my interpretation, the most likely (the fourth was somewhat less
likely, but a remote possibility, and the fifth is the last long shot.)

This is in addition to the two rejections (both from long shots) that I
received earlier.

I'll be in touch with you all as this progresses.

cheers, tycho
