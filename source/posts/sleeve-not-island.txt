===================
Sleeve (Not) Island

I thought to myself this morning "you know, I could post a quick update
on my knitting without writing a massive TealArt entry." So here I am.

Through really only minimal knitting time this week (8-10 hours since
Sunday Morning), I've managed to complete the main portion of the
sleeve. I have, several more rows and a cuff to complete.

I should order more yarn, and I need a few hours to work on the sweater
but, it's real close.

I'm taking it out of the knitting bag until this weekend, opting rather,
for the three pairs of socks I have going in my bag, and plain knit
sweater. We'll see how this goes.

Cheers, sam

ps. It's snowing out, so I feel at least somewhat confident that I'll be
able to wear this sweater this season.
