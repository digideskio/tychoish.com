The following `tweet/identica post <http://identi.ca/notice/61031249>`__
made this morning, pretty much sums up my reaction to the incumbent
holiday:

so last night I was like "why am I not getting email" and then "I
better check on the server" and then "oh right
#otherpeoplesholidays"

I'm getting on a plane later this morning to fly to my home town for the
first time since last October. It'll be good to see family and friends
out there, and I'm always appreciative of a break from some aspects of
my routine. Including the opportunity to be in my apartment during
daylight for the first time in a month.

I often think of this holiday break as a "free time" to make progress on
different things that I've had to neglect on the account of life for the
fall. While obviously more pronounced when I've been a student, I am
very much looking forward to the opportunity to get up early and write,
and spending long afternoons working on a sweater.

I think I'll have some other posts this weekend, and early next week
about the knitting project.

There'll be new `Critical Futures <http://www.criticalfutures.com/>`__
on Tuesday as there was last Tuesday (about `new
technology <http://criticalfutures.com/2010/12/new-technology/>`__). I
hope you forgive my indulgence while I get the new rhythm sorted out.

And if this is *your* holiday, I hope you enjoy it!
