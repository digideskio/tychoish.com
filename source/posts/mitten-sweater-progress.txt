Mitten (sweater) Progress

So I've been doing a little bit of knitting today. See below for
evidence of this fact.

Current projection indicates that by the end of the current repeat, I
will be at the underarm point of the sweater. If I book it, and find
something good to entertain me while I work on it.

I'm almost 60% through the yarn that I have to finish this project, and
I hope that I finish before I run out of yarn, but I suspect that the
yoke, "button band" and hem had better be less than 40% of the knitting
that I have to do.

It's chugging along. I've already started thinking of the next design,
which I think will be more textural and less blocky. I'm going to be
knitting it with much more fine yarn, but my goal is to knit something
that's much more fitted than I'm accustomed to, probably v-neck. After
that, I'm thinking a plain, drapey/soft raglan sweater with rolled hems,
and I'm not sure what kind of neck I'm going to use. Probably a lose
crew neck.

I've put the shawl away for the time being. This is probably good for my
(knitting) health.
