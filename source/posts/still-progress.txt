-  Correspondence and status update is sent. Still no news. Better luck
next week?
-  I finished the first sleeve of this g-d-forsaken sweater. I made sure
to start the next one immediately. This is good. Notes on knitting:

-  I ordered more yarn, which is needed for finishing this sleeve.
-  I also ordered yarn, enough for a second sweater. Sigh. This yarn
is more fine than my usual stardard, but it's really soft, and it
has drape in a way that I'm totally ok with. I think that I'm
going to host a knit a long with this yarn, and a sweater that I
hope to design and work on this summer.
-  This means that I will have three sweaters worth of yarn more than
I have sweaters, plus a bunch of left overs. I think this is a
stash.

Greater numbers of shorter blog post seem to be the way to go. I've
gotten the second part down, (this time), here' to working on the first
part, I guess.

Back to the knitting.
