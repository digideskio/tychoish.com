On Reading and Writing
======================

I may be a huge geek and a hacker type, but I'm a writer and reader
first, and although while I'm blathering on about my setup it might
seem like all I do is tweak my systems, the writing and reading are
really more "my thing."

I wrote that sentence a few weeks ago, and I've written a great many
more sentences since then, but I've felt that *that* sentence needs some
more exploration, particularly because while it seems so obvious and
integrated into what I do from behind the keyboard, I think it bares
some explanation for those of you playing along at home.

What "I do" in the world, is write. And that's pretty clear to me, and
has only gotten more clear in the last few years/months. There are a
couple of important facts about what "being a writer" means to me on a
"how I work" on a day to day basis. They are:

- There's a certain level of writing output that's possible in a day,
that I sometimes achieve, but it's not sustainable. I can (and do) do
the binge thing--and that has it's place--but I can't get up, pound
out two thousand or more words every day on a few projects and go to
bed happy. Doesn't work like that.

- Getting to write begets more writing, and it's largely transitive. If
I write a few hundred words of emails to blog reader, collaborators,
and listservs in the morning, what happens in the afternoon is often
more cogent than if I spend the morning checking twitter.

- Writing is always a conversation, between the writer and other
writers, between the writer and the reader, between the writer and
future writers. I find it very difficult to write, even the most
mundane things, without reading the extant discourse on the subject.

- Writing is an experimental process. I've said at work a number of
times, "you can't edit something that isn't there," and in a very
real sense, it is hard to really know "what you want" until you see
the words on the page. Written language is like that I suppose.
That's what the blog is about, I guess.

- *Ideas aren't real until they're written down.* I'm not much of a
Platonist, I guess, and I think writing things down really helps
clarify things, it helps point out the logical flaws in an argument,
and it makes it possible for other people to commend and expand on
the work that you've done. That's a *huge* part of why I blog. It's
very much *not* publication in the sense that I've created something
new and I've finished and I'm ready for other to consider it. Rather,
I blog what I'm thinking about, I use the blog *to* think about
things.

Though I think it's not clear to me (or to you) at this point, I'm very
much in the middle of a larger project at the nexus of open source
software communities, political economies, and units of authentic social
organization. The work on free software that I've been blogging, the
stuff about economics, the stuff about co-ops. I'm not sure how that's
all going to come together, but I'm working on it. Now, four months into
it, it's beginning to be clear to me that this is all one project, but
it certainly never started that way.

The technology that I write about is something that I obviously think
has merit on it's own terms--hence the `Cyborg
Institute <http://www.cyborginstitute.com>`__ Project--but it's also
very true that I use technology in order to enable me to write more
effectively, to limit distractions, to connect with readers and
colleagues more effectively, to read things more efficiently.
Technology, hacking, is mostly a means to an end.

And I think that's a really useful lesson.
