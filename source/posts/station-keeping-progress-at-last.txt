Station Keeping Progress at Last

*Sorry for posting this so late in the day, I spend the day driving
"home-home" from "school-home" and didn't get a chance to cue up the
post last night. In any case, there'll be a nifty post tomorrow about
something knitting related, I'm sure.--ty*

With school out of session this last week and a lot of free time where I
didn't have a great deal of things to do other than pack (which I
desperately wanted to avoid) and worry about the future: I got a lot of
writing done. I had basically eaten through my stash of TA posts, and it
is once again replenished, although my cushion isn't as big as it has
been. Some of this writing is even Station Keeping related, so I can
offer you a proper "*Keeping* Meta" post!

I drafted my first two *SK* installments. With luck, they'll post as 1.1
and 1.3 [1]_, with 1.2 as a story by one of the other authors. They're
both in the setup-prologue model, so they're not gripping, but some
measure of that is needed. This is part of the reason that 1.2 needs to
be there: to break it up.

In a lot of ways this is the first time that I've written fiction. Sat
down in front of a text editor and written fiction. In years, [2]_
really; and it felt great. I think I'm a better writer this time around,
but we'll all see in a little while. I'm not yet sure about the June 1st
launch date, but I've made some progress and I feel like we'll be able
to start soon, even if we don't have a writing team that's as large as I
might have wanted to start. I'll have to see how my time falls this
summer, but I'm feeling optimistic about the series even if it means
that I won't be able to write as much non-fiction/blogging stuff for
TealArt as I've grown accustomed--this might actually be a good thing.

In addition to the drafts that I wrote, I also did some work on the
writer's wiki and made some space for discussion of character
development and longer range plots (ie. story arcs.) I'm also working on
permanently blocking off the writer's wiki from public consumption,
because I can't imagine much that there is that much that wouldn't be
spoiler-y for the wiki, and frankly
`PMWiki's <http://www.pmwiki.org/>`__ native security system *sucks*.
Hopefully with that enacted, things will go better. Anyway, one of the
things that I wrote will, I hope, be interesting for you, gentle reader,
and I'd enjoy hearing what you have to say about this:

Science Fiction, as I've always experienced it, is a genre of ideas.
While I think dividing and separating one genre from another is not
a productive venture, I think that this definition is useful for the
moment. What I mean is that the reason why we write stories on alien
worlds, with fantastic technologies we can only imagine, alternate
histories and futures, and yes even on space stations orbiting far
flung space colonies is to present an idea about the future, about
the present in a digestible form. It's also fun, and I don't think
that we should be ashamed of the "fun factor," in SF, while
remembering that it can be distracting.

If we were only interested in character development, literary games
and development, representation, and so forth the space stations,
fantastic technology, and alternate timelines would be distracting
and superfluous.

That's all I have folks. I'm writing this entry a bit early because this
sunday (yesterday by your reading) I am graduating from college, as I'm
sure you're sick of hearing by now. Expect posts in the next few days
from both `hadarah <http://tychoish.com/hadarah>`__ and myself regarding
this experience.

In the mean time, be well, tycho

   fiction last summer, that I consider shameful at best.
