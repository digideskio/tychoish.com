The Times of Station Keeping

It's another week, again. It's funny how these things happen. I once
again don't have a great deal of Station Keeping news to relate to you.
Last week was somewhat frightful in terms of school. I'm graduating in
about two weeks, my final grades are due in a week and a half, and the
vast majority of my work will be completed by the middle of this week.
Because last week was so intense (on top of the sinus infection episode)
there isn't a lot of work left, but I have more than enough on my plate
to keep me busy, so while I will have entries for your consumption and
edification this week, I can't make a lot of big promises about overall
productivity this week. But I have some things to talk about now, and
that's all that matters, right?

I have two more essays for the hypertext series after this week's piece,
but I do feel as if it's wrapping up, and similarly the knitting series,
I think will see a bit of a summer transformation as I have basically
completed what I set out to do. I think we'll see more content
concerning what I'm actually working on, and some of the things that
I've already made, and of course coverage of knitting camp. I'm playing
around with the idea of starting a slightly more academic series to
follow up the hypertext, that might be a fun summer project to work on
in addition to all of the other summer things that I have planned.

Thoughts on *Station Keeping*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of my intentions with SK is to provide an outlet for short form
(science) fiction. I think there's a lot of focus and prestige given to
The Novel, in the genre, and it's certainly earned. The Novel allows
authors to write extensive stories that make it possible to put the
reader *into* another world/perspective. But there's another sense that
shorter form fiction allows writers to pose specific questions, handle
language very precisely, and practically distribute his/her work
easily [1]_. SK is also not exactly short fiction as it has serial
elements, plot arcs, and an ensemble of regular and recurring
characters, but I think from a writing perspective, there will be
stylistic and structural similarities between short fiction and SK
installments. In the group setting, this makes particular sense: we can
all create desecrate individual stories, participate in the planning of
a larger story without anyone person needing to feel obligated to
maintaining an entire project solely on their own. I think there are
possibilities.

Anyway, stay tuned, it looks like it's going to be a pretty interesting
week around here.

best, tycho

It's easier for publishers to take a risk on a piece of short fiction
than it is for a publisher to take a risk on a novel. While the
digital age might eventually change this, for the moment, this
remains true. Interestingly, SF is somewhat unique as there remains a
somewhat viable commercial short fiction market. Also, having
successful short fiction publications makes is easier to publish
longer fiction, and while the system isn't flawless certainly, it's
better than some crap shoots.
