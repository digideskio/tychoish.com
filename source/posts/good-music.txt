Good Music

I don't tend to write a lot about the music that I listen to/participate
in, I have sort of obscure tastes by contemporary standards, and have
been known to go on somewhat eccentrically. In any case, I wanted to
write briefly about two different kinds of "good music:" the great song,
and the "desert island album."

Great songs are songs that I love to listen to on endless repeat. I've
spent, literally *days* listening to a single song, they're songs that I
know most of the lyrics to (though interestingly the songs I like to
sing with other people aren't always the same "great songs.") Here's a
tentative list, in no particular order:

-  Louis Killen's singing of "The Leaving of Liverpool."
-  Finest Kind's singing of "The Rose in June" (My dad, by contrast
hates this song because it's too religious and it "takes him too long
to drown," I think it's a good song in any case.)
-  Martin Simpson's "Love Never Dies," from the Righteousness and
Humidity Album.
-  Joni Mitchell's "Case of You" (though "For Free" is a close second).
-  Richard Thompson's "Andalus/Radio Marrakesh" (The first tune on this
list, and though I like a lot of tunes, this one is amazing.)
-  Rufus Wainwright's "Hallelujah" (with due respects to Jeff Buckely,
actually it's a tie, and Wainright, very rightly cribs from Bukley.)
This song shares a brain cell with Josh Ritter's "Harrisburg," thanks
to an old roommate, and I think I might like this song more, but in
any case.
-  Michelle Shocked's "Come a Long Way,"
-  The Kippling/Bellamy (by anyone) "A Pilgrim's Way"

Desert Island Albums are something completely different,
`Judy <http://metallumai.livejournal.com/>`__ and some other people
started playing around with the question "what's the album you'd take to
a desert island, if you could only take 1?" I think we decided that it
couldn't be done in less than three, but never the less, there are some
albums which are just *divine* as complete entities in themselves, and
this doesn't necessarily overlap with the great song category very much.
Here's a tentative list of my desert island albums (order not
important):

-  Nic Jones' *The Noah's Arc Trap* (this is Judy's suggestion, and I
agree completely.)
-  Eliza Carthy's *Rough Music* (It's her latest)
-  Jethro Tull's *Thick as A Brick*
-  Bruce Springsteen's *Born to Run*
-  Martin Simpson's *The Bramble Briar*
-  Brian McNeil's *Back of the North Wind*
-  Fairport Convention's *What we did on our Holidays*

I think the former category is more subjective than the later, albeit
only slightly. Do you have any good suggestions that I might have left
off.
