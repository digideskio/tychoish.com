Better Task Lists
=================

Just about everyone keeps a task list of some sort, or has at some
point. To the casual observer, task list management might seems like a
simple problem that could be augmented with a little bit of automation
for great effect. Fire up your nearest "app store" and I would bet money
that you'll find a at least a few developers that have had the same
thought.

For such a seemingly simple engineering problem there is an inordinate
amount of really bad software. While this might tempt us to reassess the
complexity of the task management problem, I don't think this is really
true. What happens, I'm convinced, is that people (i.e. [[tag/cyborg]]s)
make lists of tasks to solve different problems in their realities, and
these different lists often require different automation. So while there
are 10-20 basic task management applications, the number of distinct
usage profiles exceeds that by several times. That's the theory at any
rate.

Archetypes
----------

Allowing for large amount of diversity, there are still a few generally
useful task list "archetypes" that we can use to characterize how people
use task lists. I just want to enumerate them, here for now. I might
move them out to another page, and you should feel free to edit the page
(it's a wiki!) if you think I've missed anything!

-  **Collaboration Facilitation**: Teams need systems to keep track of
and work on shared issue queues. These are "bug trackers," and are
totally essential when items or "issues:" take a significant time to
complete, require the effort/input/awareness of multiple people, and
need to be created or added by a number of people.

-  **Memory Enhancement**: People create todo lists when they're working
more things than they can comfortably remember at any one time. The
lists tend to be ephemeral, the items can be quickly resolved, but we
make these lists so we don't have to remember a long list of things
while working. Think post-it notes.

-  **Obligation Management**: These lists bring us close to calendars,
but we keep them to make sure we remember to do required tasks. Often
these lists are helpful in helping people make sure that they're
"caught up," so that they can enjoy and use free time without
interruption or nagging.

-  **Task Prioritization**: When time is limited, a list of tasks is
useful in organizing an order, and making use of available time, so
that it's possible to keep track of all open tasks, while also being
able to allocate effort and time to tasks in a smart way that
accounts for available time, importance, and deadlines. The goal is
to get the most crucial things done while also never wondering what
one could be doing with a few free moments.

-  **Progress Tracking**: These lists are less to track things *todo*
and more to track *have done*. When working on a number of long term
and short term projects, a list of what's open, what's been finished,
along with a status of where things are is useful to avoid loosing
track of projects and tasks.

Based on this, I think we can distill a number of overriding qualities
of task lists from these five archetypal use cases. That working list
is:

-  item granularity,
-  project-level organization,
-  scheduling and deadlines, and
-  use of priority markers. ## Personal Case Studies

When I had an epic commute my issue was that while I had free time, it
was all in 20 or 40 minute segments on trains. The challenge was to be
organized and focused enough to really use this time. It was early and
while I was awake enough to get work done, I wasn't always awake enough
to figure out what needed my attention. And I didn't have enough routine
minutia or enough other free time to be able to spend these blocks of
time doing minutia. I needed a task list that told me what to do and
when to do it. I needed *Task prioritization* with a little *obligation
management* or something close to that. I chopped every task into the
smallest actionable items, which is annoying in creative projects and
often not very useful, and then scheduled items out so that I could do 6
or so things a day, and anytime I opened the laptop there was a list of
things I could jump into. It worked, more or less.

Now, I have free time. I even have a few hours strung together. The
issue is less that I need help filling in every little moment with
something to do, and more that I have too much that I could be working
on, and I need help figuring out what the status is of ongoing projects
are and where I ought to things are and what needs my attention the
most. *Progress tracking*, more or less with a little *task
prioritization* but in a very different way than I'd been doing. it.
I've got a lot of things, and I need to be able to see where projects,
and what needs attention now. I've not figured out the best solution,
but I think less scheduling and bigger conceptual task objects is more
the way to go.

Does this way of thinking about things make sense to other people?
