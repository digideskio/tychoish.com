I `wrote a while back about wanting to develop a "fact file" or some way
of creating a database of notes and
clippings <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/fact-file-and-orbital-mechanics/>`__
that wouldn't (need to be) project specific research, but that I would
none the less like the keep track of. Part of the notion was that I felt
like I was gathering lots of information and reading lots of stuff, that
I didn't really have any good way of retaining this information beyond
whatever I could recall based on what I just happen to remember.

I should note that this post is very
`org-mode <http://www.orgmode.org>`__ focused, and I've not subtitled
very much. You've been warned.

Ultimately I developed an
`org-remember <http://orgmode.org/manual/Remember-templates.html>`__
template, and I documented that in the post linked to above.

Since then, however, I've changed things a bit, and I wanted to publish
that updated template.

::

   (setq org-remember-templates'(
     ("annotations" ?a
       "* %^{Title} %^g \n  :PROPERTIES:\n  :date: %^t\n  :cite-key: %^{cite-key}\n  :link: %^{link}\n  :END:\n\n %?"
       "~/org/data.org" "Annotations and Notes")
     ("web-clippings" ?w
       "* %^{Title} %^g \n  :PROPERTIES:\n  :date: %^t\n  :link: %^{link}\n  :END:\n\n %x %?"
       "~/org/data.org" "Web Clippings")
     ("fact-file" ?f
       "* %^{Title} %^g \n  :PROPERTIES:\n  :date: %^t\n  :link: %^{link}\n  :END:\n\n %x %?"
       "~/org/data.org" "Fact File")
     ))

What this does, reflects something I noticed in the way I was using the
original implementation. I noticed that I was collecting quotes from
both a variety of Internet sources *and* published sources. Not
everything had a cite-key (a key that tracks the information in my
bibtex database,) and I found that I also wanted to save copies of blog
posts and other snippets that I found useful and interesting, but that
still didn't seem to qualify as a "fact file entry."

So now there are three templates:

- First, annotations of published work, all cross referenced against
  cite-keys in the bibtex database.

- Second, web clippings, this is where I put blog posts, and other
  articles which I think will be interesting to revisit and important
  to archive independently for offline/later reading. Often if I
  respond to a blogpost on this blog, the chances are that post has
  made it into this section of the file.

- Third, miscellaneous facts, these are just quotes, in general.
  Interesting facts that I pull from wikipedia/wherever, but nothing
  teleological, particularly. It's good to have a place to collect
  unstructured information, and I've found the collection of
  information in this section of the file to be quite useful.

General features:

- Whatever text I select (and therefore add to the X11 clipboard) is
  automatically inserted into the remember buffer (with the ``%?`` tag)

- I make copious use of tags and tag compleation which makes it easier
  to use the "sparse tree by tag" functionality in org-mode to just
  display heading which are tagged in a certain way.) So that I can see
  related content easily. Tags include both subject and project-related
  information for super-cool filtering.

- All "entires" exist on the second level of the file. I'm often
  sensative to using too much hierarchy, at the expense of clarity or
  ease of searching. This seems to be particularly the case in
  org-mode, given the power of sparse trees for filtering content.

So that's what I'm doing. As always, alternate solutions feedback are
more than welcome.
