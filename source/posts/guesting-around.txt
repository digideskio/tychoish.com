I don't have a good new post for *tychoish* today, it's been eventful,
and I seem to have about half a spare brain cell.

I did *however* manage to get posts up for a couple of guest blogging
things:

- `A post on
Zimmermania <http://zimmermaniacs.blogspot.com/2008/05/latvian-news.html>`__,
with a finished picture of a sweater that I worked on a while back
(I'm behind on sweater posting, it's true)...

- `A post <http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=348>`__ on `the Feminist
Science Fiction Blog <http://blogs.feministsf.org>`__ about "the
singularity" and possible theoretical interactions with feminist
ideas. It's sort of rambling, but a good start.

I'll be back plenty soon enough, you just wait and see.
