Hello fellow knitters,

I'd like to present you with the diary's of a begging knitter from an
old friend. It's delightful, and frankly reminds me a lot of my own
trials learning knitting. Let's note that I said learning knitting, not
learning how to knit, It looks like indi, is attempting to figure out
*knitting,* not just how to do it. He's going to be awesome at it soon.

I've Learned to Knit. and Not Quite Right.
