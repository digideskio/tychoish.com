I posted something along these lines to the `writing
list <http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/sf-writing>`__ a few days ago, and
I kept meaning to write some sort of bah humbag post about new years
eves and new years resolutions (because thats my M.O. about holidays.)
But then I realized that somehow it was already New Years Eve, and that
I'd end up posting my non-resolution at the same time that everyone was
posting theirs, so... whatever. Here we are.

Truth is I think the January 1 marker is a sort of lame beginning of the
new year. I think August/September is a much better point in the year
(at least in the northern hemisphere). I can't decide if it's the
academic or the jew, but whichever, I tend to do most of the
resolutioning then, and often pretty much ignore Janurary 1. Tonight,
I'm siting at home doing the same thing I always do. But that's the way
I am.

So anyway, the resolution.

This year, I'm going to create a file called "read.txt" and list the
books that I read as I read them. While I've been reading more in the
last year, and this is a good thing, I still think that I need to read
more. I hope that by tracking the books--just the titles and authors,
too much work and I'll loose interest--I'll read more. What's more, I
think that I often read more than I think I do, I just never seem to
remember it in the moment. Having a list will help this.

That's all. I want to write in the new year, but I'm doing that now, so
no use to resolve to do it. So I'm done.

See you on the flip side.
