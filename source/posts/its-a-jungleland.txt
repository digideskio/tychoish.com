Bruce Springsteen's Jungleland keeps coming up on my ipod's random play.
I'm not sure what it means. Until this started, I wasn't a big fan of
the song, but it's grown on me.

I have a few more days of work, and I have a couple of weeks left of
TealArt posts, more or less, but I changed my `website on my
twitter <http://tychoish.com>`__, and while I'd like to continue to have
daily content on TealArt, I don't think I can (or want) keep up the
march that it's going to be to keep the content in stock. I have a
couple of weeks to figure things out.

Stay tuned, of course.

ps. I think I'm addicted to this Springsteen, I just hit replay on it.
