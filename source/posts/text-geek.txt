Ok, it's clear to everyone, I'm sure that I'm a huge text geek, but also
being a social scientist, I suppose I have to ask a question...

Now I'm not perfectly up on the "vi vs. emacs" history, but...

in the "bbedit vs. text-mate" debate, am I correct in assuming that
bbedit is emacs and text-mate is vi?

I mean I know that TextMate (mac programs in general) more or less uses
emacs key bindings, and there's nothing mode-wise that's quite like
vi(m), but despite that....

anyone want to fight me on this ;)
