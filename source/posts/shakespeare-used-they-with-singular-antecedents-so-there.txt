Shakespeare used "they" with singular antecedents. So there! > "Because
when a construction is clearly present several times in Shakespeare's
rightly admired plays and poems, and occurs in the carefully prepared
published work of just about all major writers down the centuries, and
is systematically present in the unreflecting conversational usage of
just about everyone including Sean Lennon, then the claim that it is
ungrammatical begins to look utterly unsustainable to us here at
Language Log Plaza. This use of they isn't ungrammatical, it isn't a
mistake, it's a feature of ordinary English syntax that for some reason
attracts the ire of particularly puristic pusillanimous pontificators,
and we don't buy what they're selling."
