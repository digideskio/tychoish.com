Before I got started down my current career path--that would be the
information management/work flow/web strategy/technology and cultural
analyst path--I worked in a library.

I suppose I should clarify somewhat as the image you have in your mind
is almost certainly not accurate, both of what my library was like and
of the kind of work I did.

I worked in a research library at the big local (private) university,
and I worked not in the part of library where students went to get their
books, but in the "overflow area" where the special collections, book
preservation unit, and the catalogers all worked. What's more, the unit
I worked with had an archival collection of film/media resources from a
few documentary film makers/companies, so we didn't really have *books*
either.

Nevertheless it was probably one of the most instructive experiences
I've had. There are things about the way Archives work, particularly
archives with difficult collections, that no one teaches you in those
"how to use the library" and "welcome to library of congress/dewy
decimal classification systems" lessons you get in grade school/college.
The highlights?

- **Physical and Intellectual Organization** While Archives keep track
of, and organize all sorts of information about their collections,
the organization of this material "on the shelf" doesn't always
reflect this.

Space is a huge issue in archives, and as long as you have a record or
"where" things are, there's a lot of incentive to store things in the
way that will take up the least amount of space physically. Store
photographs, separately from oversized maps, separately from file boxes,
separately from video cassettes, separately from CDs (and so forth.)

- "Series" and intellectual cataloging - This took me a long time to
get my head around, but Archivists have a really great way of taking
a step back and looking at the largest possible whole, and then
creating an ad-hoc organization and categorization of this whole, so
as to describe in maximum detail, and make finding particular things
easier. Letters from a specific time period. Pictures from another
era.

- An acceptance that perfection can't be had. Perhaps this is a symptom
of working with a collection that had only been archived for several
years, or working with a collection that had been established with
one large gift, rather than as a depository for a working collection.
In any case, our goal--it seemed--was to take what we had and make it
better: more accessible, more clearly described, easier to process
later, rather than to make *the whole thing* absolutely perfect. It's
a good way to think about organizational project.

In fact, a lot of what I did was to take files that the film producers
had on their computers and make them useful. I copied disks off of old
media, I took copies of files and (in many cases, manually) converted
them to use-able file formats, I created index of digital holdings.
Stuff like that. No books were harmed or affected in these projects, and
yet, I think I was able to make a productive contribution to the project
as a whole.

The interesting thing, I think, is that when I'm looking through my own
files, and helping other people figure out how to manage all the
information--data, really--they have, I find that it all boils down to
the same sorts of problems that I worked with in the library: How to
balance "work-spaces" with storage spaces. How to separate intellectual
and physical organizations. How to create usable catalogs and indices's
of a collection. How to lay everything down so that you can, without
"hunting around" for a piece of paper lay your hands on everything in
your collection in a few moments, and ultimately how to do this without
spending very much energy on "upkeep."

Does it make me a dork that I find this all incredibly interesting and
exciting?
