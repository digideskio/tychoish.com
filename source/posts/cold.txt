**tycho** *discussion of plans for tomorrow, turn to discussion of the
weather*: but it's going to be fucking cold tomorrow, and I don't want
to have to walk 4 blocks in the snow.

**C.E**: It is going to be bad tomorrow?

**tycho**: you were the one who was out there today, it was hell.

**C.E.**: But I think it's going to be like 40, I hear.

**tycho** *outraged that the weather broke*: What! G-d! What the hell
kind of dumb ass weather is that?

*Pause.*

**tycho**: You know, up north I'd always just dress in the morning for
the weather the previous day, and it was almost always right, maybe it'd
be a little bit iffy in October and April, but generally, I was ok.
Here, since May, it's like the weather is out there to fuck with you.
Snow, followed by the fifties. Sixty degree weather alternating with 100
degree weather. I hope someone's amused because I'm not!

Pause. **tycho** returns to reading his book.
