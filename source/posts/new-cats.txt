Hah, so the new cats arrived today.

One is grey and splotchy (white belly, really just grey and white in a
vaguely tuxedo cat with hints of tabby stripes. so really, we're talking
about a grey casual/pinstriped suited cat) named Kip. Kip after Kipruget
Koroso in James Tiptree, Jr.'s *Brightness Falls from the Air*. Also I
have a character in a number of my stories named Kyp, so it's a name I'm
fond of.

The other one is all grey, and we're calling it "Finn" after the sheep.

They both have somewhat lengthy fur, their mother has long fur. I took
some new pictures with photo booth. because I now have a computer with a
camera and therefore have *no* excuses.

Back to your regularly scheduled programing.
