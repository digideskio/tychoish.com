Software Rundown

I have in the past done a little bit of writing to explore and and list
the software that I'm using in my computing life to keep on top of
things and stay organized. What inevitably happens when I do this is
that I change almost instantly afterwards to different solutions and
programs. Alas.

While I don't want to jinx anything, I've recently noticed that I've
been using the same programs for a couple of months now, and I'm
probably at a record low for complaints and frustrations with this set
up. So go figure. Here's what I'm using these days.

- **Mail.app** for email. It's clearly not perfect, but I can't imagine
  anything better, and frankly the organization of my incoming email is
  such a tower of cards, that I'm reluctant to change anything.

- **`DevonThinkPRO <http://www.devon-technologies.com/>`__** for
  database/content management. This is an incredibly powerful program,
  and I continue to use it to store a lot of stuff, though I haven't
  been using it as much recently because I'm not in school and I,
  unfortunately, haven't been doing enough to get to a place where I
  need to use it. For the DTP geeks out there, I'm keeping everything
  in one database that's 1.56 GBs big, with about 1mg of synched text
  and RTF files.

- **`NetNewsWire <http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/>`__**
  and **`Camino <http://www.caminobrowser.org/>`__** for web browsing
  and feed reading. It's how I consume the internet. I suppose I still
  wish that NNW would let me read f-locked LiveJournal entries (which
  some of the other programs do), but other than that, no complaints
  here.

- **`AdiumX <http://www.adiumx.com/>`__** for chatting. I've been using
  Adium since I switched to mac, and it's great, and I think that the
  program has gotten even better, particularly recently, so check it
  out.

- `**MarsEdit** <http://ranchero.com/marsedit/>`__ Great program for
  offline editing. I find that I've taken to doing a lot of my editing
  in web-interfaces these days, and at least theoretically TextMate
  could prevent some of this, but a lot of my postings are time
  delayed, so that's not really a problem. And I'm checking stats on
  the web-pannel's anyway, so again, not a big deal. It's still great
  software.

- `**Pukka** <http://codesorcery.net/pukka>`__ for del.icio.us posting.
  It's small and it works great. Can't argue with that. I don't post to
  `my del.icio.us <http://del.icio.us/tychoish/>`__ enough, but that's
  another problem.

- `**VLC** <http://www.videolan.org/vlc/>`__ for playing videos. All
  videos, without complaining. Great stuff.

- **Preview.app** for reading PDFs, because I just don't like the other
  programs enough, and I figure, it's best to leave well enough alone.

- **Terminal.app** for `bash
  shell <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bash>`__ goodness. It's sort of
  surprising how much shell stuff I've gotten into in the past couple
  of months. It's been nice to be able to figure out how to do some
  stuff in the shell, and it's nice to have that fast interface. I wish
  I were a bit more hardcore about it, but I'm learning slowly.

  A couple of programs that I like and keep, but don't find myself using
  very much this summer. I expect that I'll get back into some of them.

- **`WriteRoom <http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/projects/writeroom>`__**
  for distraction free writing. It's basically a big black screen with
  big green lettering that auto scrolls. It's simple, yes, but I really
  like how this software can allow me to be productive at odd times. I
  have to say that

- **`Quicksliver <http://quicksilver.blacktree.com>`__** I haven't been
  using QS as much recently, I'm not sure why. I think that a lot of
  the things I have been using QS for in the past, I do with the shell
  anyway. Go figure.

- **`Growl <http://growl.info/>`__** for system wide notifications. I
  sometimes turn it off and forget to turn it back on. It's great to
  get notifications of what's going on on your computer so that you're
  aware of what's happening, and then can keep on working on what
  you're working on without getting caught up in checking for new IMs
  or Emails or download compilations, and so forth.

- **[TextMate](http://macromates.com/ "TextMate ‚Ä" The Missing Editor
  for Mac OS X")** I use this program constantly, and it's great. I've
  changed a lot of things in response to this program, and I rather
  like it a lot. It's nice to have all this power in such an intuitive
  environment. The `Maruku <http://www.maruku.com.au/>`__ tool, in
  combination with text-mate, has basically become my word-processor of
  choice. I use it to write blog entries and to code/program the
  websites. I use it in my job, and I'm thinking about using it to try
  to do the GTD thing again, so we'll see.

My only real usage complaint at the moment is that my system of
organizing text-files is more like a folder with a bunch of papers in it
than an actual notebook. Maybe just opening my text-files folder as a
project in TextMate will solve this, but I feel like something could be
done. Also I think I'd like to be able to check my writing and whatnot
into a `subversion repository <http://subversion.tigris.org/>`__ for
backup and archiving purposes, but that's mostly a point of lazyness,
not a problem as such. I'll get back to you on these points though.

Thanks for geeking out with me.

Cheers, ty
