The original Star Trek was meant to be set 300 years in the future from
the original air date, that obviously got mucked up with the
fast-forward to TNG and the rest of the stories in that era, but still:
300 years at some point seemed like enough to get us out of our current
problems and woes.

The foundation books are dated in the 10-11k, but it's unclear if they
use the same scale that we're using (likely they are).

I'm not sure how much of "news" this is because we haven't explicitly
said this, but I see Station Keeping as being set in the far flung
future: present + 10k years.

At the same time, I just dated the narrative--but not the events of the
story---I'm writing now at 2597.

Just interesting...
