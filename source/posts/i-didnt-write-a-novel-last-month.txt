I didn't write a novel last month.

I've always been a bit of a contrarian about
`NaNoWriMo <http://www.nanowrimo.org/>`__, the project where writers and
people who don't think of themselves as writers attempt a novel writing
sprint during the month of November. Well, it's a 50,000 word "novel,"
which is in the end a bit short for a novel and a bit too long for a
novella, but we'll call it a novel for the sake of simplicity.

My basic gripe is that NaNoWriMo is a fun gimmick for people who aren't
used to turning out huge volumes of writing every day anyway, it doesn't
do a lot to really ensure or guarantee success. At it's heart NaNo has a
very democratizing idea: anyone can write a novel, I fear that it does
more to impede success than encourage it.

My reasoning:

- November is the worst month, with the holidays and the time change,
potentially. November also tends to be bad for people who are in
school or who teach school, as the semester draws to an end. December
might be *even* worse in these respects. Here are some arguments for
other months: February or March, (in the northern hemisphere) are
cold months where you just want to stay at home, and what better time
to write a novel? May is upbeat and fresh. June has no major holidays
and rides a wave of Summer euphoria. Defenders of NaNo say "There's
no good month, so we might as well use November." I reject this
logic. Picking a bad month of the year can do a lot for the success
rate of the people who attempt the project, I figure.

- The novel is too short. While it would probably also decrease success
rate to make the NaNo Novel a publishable length (60-80k or so), I
think having people end up with a piece that's sort of unusable in
the "real world" can be discouraging as well. If they get something
they like from NaNo, and they want to publish it, they have to write
at least another ten thousand words and possibly as much as 50
thousand words. Digital distribution helps these things a bit, but
the size is an issue.

- What "real writers" do, is write *every single day*. The trick to
being able to be a writer isn't the ability to turn out a quantity of
prose on demand. It's the ability to sustainably work on projects all
year round. To turn off the internal editor long enough that you get
something on the paper, and then turn it back on so that "something"
doesn't suck. They're able to take `experiences and turn them into
texts <http://criticalfutures.com/2009/11/i-am-a-writer/>`__.

- I'm not sure that the fetishization of the novel form is particularly
productive. I think there's a lot of power and future in `shorter
forms <http://www.365tomorrows.com/>`__. For learning how to be a
writer, writing shorter works is probably a more effective way to
learn to tell stories and create characters anyway.

Having said that, congrats to the people who did NaNo. Keep writing.
You've probably found a few extra hours in your day that you didn't know
you had. Keep writing and doing awesome things with that time. And if
you're a huge fan of NaNo, don't worry too much about me, I'm just an
ornery guy with too many opinions.

It's true: I've been working on a Novel for more than a year, and while
I'm closing in on the end of the draft. Its now done yet. Soon, perhaps.
Also, I think I should probably do some blogging here about learning to
write, and teaching writing given that I got here by way of a strange
path and feel so strongly about these things.
