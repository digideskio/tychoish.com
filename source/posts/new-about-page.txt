*I rewrote the about page for tychoish this weekend. Because it was
about damn time, really, and though this one doesn't cover much new
ground the format isn't so... ass-y. And because it's a slow blogging
week, it's also a post. Have a good day, check out `today's critical
futures story <http://criticalfutures.com/>`__, and I'll catch you
around tomorrow.--ty*

This place is mine, I'm your host tycho garen. I'm just your average
geeky, male knitter, who write science fiction, and posts to his 'blog
about things like `writing <http://tychoish.com/tag/writing/>`__,
current `knitting <http://tychoish.com/tag/knitting/>`__,
`technology <http://tychoish.com/tag/technology/>`__,
`academia <http://tychoish.com/tag/academia/>`__, and other shiny topics
that catch my attention.

I've been blogging for a long time, the archive goes back to 2003 (but I
don't think you should read those anyway) and I've found residual
evidence of my online presence going back to early 2001, and I'm pretty
sure that I was doing this kind of thing since mid '99 give or take a
little, but I'm almost glad that there isn't a firm record of that early
stuff. Once upon a time I collaborated on sites with `Chris
Knittel <http://www.cgkreality.com>`__, but in 2007 we decided to divide
up the archive and start posting independently. Hence
`tychoish.com <http://tychoish.com>`__.

In truth during the first (*many years*) I posted infrequently, but
since the spring of 2007, I've made a point of posting something at
least once a day. When I started tychoish, I thought that it would be
like my paper notebook--a random collection of thoughts, lists, and raw
ideas--only digital. Which meant that I might actually go back and use
it more than once, and it might be a cool discussion starter, since I
don't have a lot to hide. Also, about this time
`tumblelogs <http://www.tumblr.com/>`__ became popluar (again), and I
thought "nifty! want." And seeing that I tend to post several hundred
words of rough prose every day, you can see how well *that* idea went.

With the rhythm of daily posting pretty much under my belt, and a rather
substantial reevaluation of the role of fiction writing in my life, in
July of 2007 I launched a new website called *`Critical
Futures <http://criticalfutures.com/>`__.* I've been interested in
hypertext and the future of prose and fiction on the internet for a long
time, and *CF* is a blog where I post manageable snippets of stories
every day of the week. Eventually, I hope that CF will be a paying
market and there'll work from other similarly minded SF writers, but for
the moment it's a fun experiment and great motivation to write and edit
(somewhat) my work regularly.

And before you ask, tycho garen isn't *really* my name. I mean, it is in
a sense, it's just not what people in real life call me, nor is it
what's on my birth certificate. I like it for both of these reasons, and
because it references some of my early writing, it allows me some
measure of privacy or separation between my cyber- and meat-space
identities, and it helps that it is an unequivocally cool name. I don't
capitalize it (nor my given name much) because names are as much
adjectives as they are proper nouns, and particularly since tycho isn't
an official name, it seems even sillier to capitalize it.

That's me. My email is all over this site, and my username on most major
websites/communications services is "tychoish," if you want to get a
hold of me, you know how. I love hearing from readers and fellow
bloggers.

If I left something out, don't be afraid to ask.

Onward and `Upward <http://criticalfutures.com>`__!
