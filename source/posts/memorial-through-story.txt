Memorial Through Story

Collecting stories to build a World Trade Center memorial BL Ochman has
alerted me to this excellent initiative. The World Trade Center Memorial
Foundation is collecting stories about 9/11. I guess we all remember
what we were doing when this tragic event unfolded.

The story-base will be significant and I can see how it will be an
effective memorial. With such a rich resource it would be a shame to see
its potential unfulfilled. Here are a couple of ways it could be
enhanced. People should be encouraged to interact with the stories by
being able to comment on them and perhaps tagging and rating each story
according to its impact on the reader. The group intelligence would
arise from these interactions and provide assistance for new users
seeking stories that matter to them."

I'm really intrigued by storytelling in general, and while the Trade
Center is so totally not the cultural moment that I'm interested in
exploring, I think what this project proposes is really interesting. If
memorial can take forms like the Berlin Holocaust memorial (see blog
post which discusses it here,) then why can't memorial take an
intellectual space like story base? And isn't that really cool, as a
concept?

Just a thought...
