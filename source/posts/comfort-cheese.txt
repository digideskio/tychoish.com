I, rather innocently, posted something to

The canonical text is:

signs you've spent too much time in the upper midwest: sometimes
when stressed, you impulse buy cheese

I spent three years in Wisconsin--southern Wisconsin--for college. Ever
since then I've related to cheese differently.

So here's what happened:

I was shopping, Mostly minding my own business when I passed the cheese
display. Not the fancy cheese display, you know, but the one next to the
designer coffee creamers, and the pre-made baking doughs.

And, pretty much before I realized what had happened, I scooped up a
half pound of store-brand mozzarella. I don't think I even stopped the
cart.

In the parking lot, I realized what had happened. I had cheese at home.
A half pound of Munster--and pretty nice Munster I thought, though I've
not met a Munster I didn't like--waited for me in the fridge at home.
The reason why I got it? Easy:

A few weeks ago, I was in Philadelphia staying with a friend who grew up
in the Twin Cities and we had the most *amazing* mozzarella for dinner.
I looked up after my second slice and said. "Wow, we're so Midwestern."
It was undeniably true. A friend from the east cost, immediately
confirmed for us that she thought we were weird. But it was amazing
cheese. And we didn't

As for my little block of cheese: it too was amazing. Not quite as good,
I suppose, but it was refreshing and in a weird way it reminded me of
home.

The people on Facebook also responded with a rather active little
thread. Morris dancers from Minnesota. Contra Dancers from St. Louis.
Classmates from College. Perhaps my experience wasn't uncommon.

Cheese. Who would have thought it.
