======================================
Breaking the Back of a Writing Project
======================================

I've been writing today, and it's been pretty good. Here are some
reflections.

I do this thing as I'm nearing the completion of a big writing project
where, at some point between writing sessions I'll quickly list all of
the things between where I am now and where I need to be by the end, so
that I don't leave things out, and that the ending falls together
without having to fight at the end. At exactly what point I start doing
this, I'm not sure, I think the end needs to be in sight for me to be
able to start doing that. And I've mostly started that for the project
I'm working on. I've been working on this project for about 6 weeks so
far, so I think that this is probably a good healthy rate, and I really
like how this story works with the format. I'm pretty excited about it.

Chapter 5 was a bit shorter than all of the chapters that precded it,
but it was very firm in it's declaration that it was over, so I'm
letting it be. Given that, even in the "tough part" of the story where I
felt like there wasn't enough happening, there were action scenes and
scenes that I had to cut way back, and from here on out, I have a lot of
stuff to cover, so I'm in good shape. Since I've been planning for ten
chapters, and todays work was in chapter six, this is the first time
I've worked on the "second half," and it's a good feeling.

Having said all of that, I'm switching gears a bit, to see if I can get
some other stuff done. So expect more updates coming soon.
