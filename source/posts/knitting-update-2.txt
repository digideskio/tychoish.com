I've hinted in the last couple of weeks that I've been knitting more.
While usually the summer heat doesn't deter me from knitting very much,
between the extra-time writing, working a lot, and the heat I hadn't
knit much since the spring. While I've certainly been *more* obsessed
with knitting in the past, I think I'm back.

Though I stopped/slowed my knitting progress for several months, I still
had unfinished projects and stash/project plans. So maybe it wasn't so
much that I stopped knitting as it was that the bottom fell out of my
productivity. In any case,as I return, my primary project has/is to
finish all of my outstanding projects. They are:

1. The gray sweater. I figure I started it in late 2005, and have been
working on it sporadically since then. It's fingering weight, and I'm
knitting it with US 1 needles. It's slow going, and mostly stocking
stitch, though there are some cable accents, including a cable
running from the collar to the cuff (via shoulder strap.) I'm done
with everything except the sleeves and I'm making progress on the
first sleeve. I expect to finish this in the next month-six weeks.
2. In preparation for knitting camp I started knitting a sweater. I had
planned for it to be an EPS system yoke sweater, and that it would be
something that I could knit at camp. Turns out that I knit other
things while I was at camp, and after camp I was largely uninterested
in knitting a yoke style sweater. So I ripped out a couple of inches
of yoke and started knitting a sweater with shaped armholes. I've
finished the body, but I need to knit the collar. Also the sleeves,
and I'm totally undecided about how to shape the upper sleeve. I
don't really like capped sleeves, but I think I need to do something,
so we'll see.
3. The `Latvian Dreaming <http://tychoish.com/tags/lativan-dreaming/>`__
sweater, which I'm almost to the shoulders, which I don't have a plan
for. I'm waiting in part till I'm done with plain yoke sweater before
I figure out what I'm doing on this sweater.

(And, *cough* two shawls, but they don't count.)

What are you working on?
