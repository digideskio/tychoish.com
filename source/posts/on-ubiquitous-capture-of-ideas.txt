On Ubiquitous Capture of Ideas

I stumbled upon `this article about
"capture" <http://www.positivityblog.com/index.php/2007/09/12/why-you-should-write-things-down/>`__,
or the practice of consistently writing ideas and thoughts down so that
you can recall them later, and completely avoid that feeling of "I wish
I remembered that brilliant idea that I had in the middle of the night,
but was too lazy to write myself a note about."

So I had an idea last night as I was falling asleep, for an essay
project that built on some stuff that I'd written a while ago, and would
have acomplished something that no other project, exactly, was
acomplishing. Good idea right?

Well, not so much. Thankfully (or not) I was able to remember, and egad
folks, it was bad.

Sometimes forgetting the productions of your sleep deprived brain is
really the way to go.
