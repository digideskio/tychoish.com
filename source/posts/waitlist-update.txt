waitlist update

I just got an email from my prospective advisor at the school I'm on the
wait-list for today.

*Days on the waitlist:* **26**-ish (One week and 2 days till, the rough
end).

Anyway, apparently the department sent out rejections a few days ago,
and I got sent one ***except it was in error***

*I have **not** been rejected.*

(Yet.)

The interesting bits of information that I was able to glean from this
email are:

- he said and I quote "--At this point, we still have to wait for
everyone who has received their offers to 'make up their minds'. So -
please hang in"

- he said "everyone" (which means that many or all of the people
they gave offers to haven't confirmed with them. As we're almost a
week out from the deadline, this uncertainty on their part is
probably good. It's not a done deal yet, and because of the
ranking of this school, it probably means that people are
jockeying for better slots, or aren't bothering to officially
decline offers.
- I know that at *worst* there are be 8 people in front of me
(including people who got offers). I suspect that there are 4-6
slots in this program. So I'm person 5(6 or 7)-9, and given how
long this is dragging on, the better my chances are..
