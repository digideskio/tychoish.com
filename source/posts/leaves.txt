Ok, so I'm going to be really busy all day, and probably pretty brain
dead after that. So no real post today.

I'd write about my knitting, except that I think I screwed up *another*
project. I haven't gotten any knitting to work out in a really long
time, and I'm sort of fed up with it for the moment. So nothing there.

Anyway, in lieu of an actual post. If you could all think of something
clever to post in the comments, that would be really awesome. A joke,
something funny that happened to you today, it all works. I'm going to
look forward to hearing what you say. If this were in the plan (see the
previous post), I would have come up with some sort of nifty contest or
game we/you could play, but alas.

See you on the other side!
