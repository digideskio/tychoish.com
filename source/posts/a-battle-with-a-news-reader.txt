a battle with a news-reader

Once upon a time a boy named tycho really hated
`RSS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)>`__ readers, they
were clunky and didn't save much time because most websites didn't have
feeds, and the ones that did had excerpt feeds.

Then tycho got a Mac and discovered
`NetNewsWire <http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/>`__ and
by this time the *internets* had clicked over to `version
2.0 <http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html>`__
and he started using RSS a lot, it saved him time and let him use even
more of the internets at once, no matter where he was. And everything
had RSS feeds and he was happy.

But he never unsubscribed from a feed--ever--and before he noticed,
there were 520 feeds. Everytime he hit refresh on the reader, there were
another 1300 items to read. Reading the *internets* became a nag, rather
than a pleasure.

Something had to be done, and so he worked on eliminating feeds that he
didn't read or didn't enjoy reading--like the ones for usenet groups, or
`del.icio.us <http://del.icio.us/>`__ tags--and slowly but surely he was
able to limit the number of subscriptions to 270. This meant that
whenever he hit refresh there were about 300 items to read. He was
happy.

That's more like it!

With luck I can weed a few more out and hopefully this will help me
become a better blog citizen. If I'm reading fewer things, hopefully
I'll be able to read more throughly and be able to respond more often,
but I'd like to be able to get it down some more.
