the bad news: my next year is unsure. once again. pondering the
possibility of being a lame-o and staying here (believe me, not option
one, but life happens).

the good news: new eager station keeping contributor possibility.

given this, we must pose this question: will I have a ph.d. or be a
science fiction internet sensation first? cast your votes now.

or should I just stick to knitting.
