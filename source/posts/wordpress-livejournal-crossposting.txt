WordPress -> LiveJournal Crossposting
=====================================

While I'd seen the `LJ
crossposter <http://ebroder.net/livejournal-crossposter/>`__ before, for
some reason I'd never really installed it. Now I have. This post should
be the first crosspost between this site
`tychoish <http://tychoish.com>`__ and the `tychoish
livejournal <http://tychoish.livejournal.com/>`__.

I was in the `MarsEdit <http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/>`__ support
room--mostly because I like to be supportive of programs I like--and I
thought, you know there has to be a good way to automate the
Wordpress-LJ mess. I can't get rid of LJ, and I don't want to have LJ be
my only blog-output.

So cross posting, is probably the best idea. In the past (and still, I
suppose) I've used `LJs feed importer
option <http://syndicated.livejournal.com/tealart/profile>`__ for
`TealArt <http://tychoish.com/>`__,

In truth I'll probably need to tweak the settings a bit, and while I
initially thought that it would be cool to take care of this on my end,
this seems like the kind of thing that might actually be best done on
the server. I mean when in doubt use a supercomputer to do something
rather than my trusty little powerbook g4.
