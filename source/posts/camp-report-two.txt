I don't have a lot to report.

I knit a lot, that was really good. The party promises to be great
tonight.

I got my `1000 Knitters Project <http://the-panopticon.blogspot.com>`__
portrait taken today. I'm somewhere in the 900s, and I'm within 20 of
people like Meg (and Cully!) Swansen, Medrith Glover, and
Emily-freaking-Ocker. How cool is that.

I'm also going to be in the project as tycho garen, rather than my real
name. That felt like a big decision, but meh.

I got yarn, including an order that I put in more than a year ago. So
much cool stuff to knit, I swear. I'm probably in stock with yarn for
the rest of the year. And a fun year it will be indeed.

I thought that I'd be more reflective, and I'm sorry that I didn't get
this out earlier. Anyway, back to the festivities.
