Ha. Here's a list because the fact that I can still use words is kind of
amazing.

-  I left and drive back across *HomeState* today. It was an uneventful
drive.

-  I listend to the 3 (!) Episodes of `FLOSS
weekly <http://twit.tv/FLOSS>`__ and 2 Episodes of
`Cast-On <http://www.cast-on.com/>`__ while I drove. This was really
good. It's surprising and good how much both of these podcasts really
inspire and stretch the brain. Listening to the programers talk about
programingy-things streatches my brain. I'm a geek, I know and have
come to really enjoy the geekier bounds of everyday computer useage;
but, I'm not a programer, and I don't often think in that mode. So,
the opportunity to stretch the brain a little, or a lot, is really
great. Really great. And Cast-On is delightful, as always.

-  I have a sneaky idea regarding Breakout, regarding my post earlier
today about needing to really rethink it. I wrote that yesterday
morning, which seems like it was much longer, but the time has been
helpful. And we'll see what happens. I'm excited now.

-  I spent much of my morning working on some knitting. I got a lot
done, which is good. I however made a crucial error on the final
step, and now have to go back. Which will be tedious. I think I shall
knit socks for a while. Sorry if, while I'm irritated with this
sweater if I don't wax rhapsodic about my knitting. It's better this
way.

-  I checked out the always helpful `MacRumors Buyers
Guide <http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/>`__ which shows when all of
the apple products were last released and what the release history
is. Apple's been pretty consistent with the computer that I'm looking
to get: revs in late fall, and late spring for the past five years.
I'm not desperate enough that I can't wait till the next rev, so I
think that's the plan. I think it's a fair bit that the next rev of
the laptops will have:

-  LED backlights
-  Multi-Touch Trackpad gestures
-  Better procs

These are all things that I want, and I can wait a few months. This
is just punditry but based on the buyers guide, there might be a late
spring mac book pro, before WWDC. Might they release new laptops in
February at whatever event the iPhone SDK is released at? Apple
punditry is so addictive.

-  I've been working on, with some seriousness, the 14th episode of
Station Keeping. Astute readers will discover that season one only
had 12 episodes. So work does continue. Ep 14 is a double length one.
So posted over two days. This is probably the result of poor planing
on my part. Because SK is basically a blog post, I don't really think
of it as "writing accomplishment," which is a shame and probably
something that I need to adjust. Sigh

-  Oh, and I finally have a nifty idea for a podcast, that I'm going to
start work on pronto. I think I need as many good copies of the tune
that Peter Bellamy set "The Pilgram's Way," to. I think I might need
to barter with our favorite local box player.

Ok, my brain dies of tiredness.

See you on the flip side,

tycho
