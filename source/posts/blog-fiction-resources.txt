Blog Fiction Resources

As I am, apparently, entering into a new blogging niche, I've been
trying to get the word out about `Critical
Futures <http://criticalfutures.com/>`__ and looking around at the
field. Here's a link dump with what I've found, if you're interested.

-  `Space Haggis <http://spacehaggis.com/>`__ - Great name and it has an
interactive element which I think is really clever, though it's not
*my* piece of cake, I can totally see why this project is so popular.
-  `BlogFiction Blog <http://blog.blogfiction.org/>`__ - Good meta
site/community. Good resource.
-  `Sound of the Void <http://soundofthevoid.blogspot.com/>`__ - Fairly
straightforward "blog-novel," but it's there.
-  `flogalicious <http://www.jillianne-hamilton.com/flog/>`__ given my
readership, I think the term "flog" for fiction blog is likely to
cause more confusion than it's worth, but this is a great directory,
though I'd love to be able to offer some advice for folks as they
write their blurbs.
-  `fiction volante <http://fiction-volante.blogspot.com/>`__ - Though
it's almost over, the concept is really cool, and my hat's off to the
author for a successful year.
-  `Horton's Folly <http://hortonsfolly.blogspot.com/>`__ - This blog is
more of a fictional blog, that is, not a blog of someone's fiction
project, but rather a blog by a fictional character. Interesting
idea, and I do like the way that it toys with identity, and
narration. I'm clearly pretty fond of this kind of play.
-  `A Change and Weather <http://talistay.bitpartmedia.com/>`__ this is
another single project blog, fantasy (there seems to be an abundance
of fantasy in the blog fiction world,) and it looks pretty nifty.
-  `The Wikipedia article <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_fiction>`__
is also a great resource, though I think it's not a particularly good
exemplar of wikipedia.
-  **ETA:** `tor.com <http://www.tor.com/>`__ - I just got my beta
invite from the new tor website. It's very nice. I'm excited. In
*some* respects this is just a traditional formed venue online, so
we'll see how it works out, but the truth is that there aren't many
of these types of publications either, so it's welcome.

There's also a multitude of original (and otherwise) fiction on
livejournal, I'm not going to pretend to catalogue that in anyway. Do
people have other favorites?
