So I totally got a comment from `jared <http://sportivethoughts.com/>`__
over on TealArt, I think mostly trying to recruit me for his Deleuze
blog-carnival (which I'm totally onboard with), but it was nice. He has
a good blog, for those of you who are interested in the Deleuze [1]_ ;)

Actually I'm really impressed with it, and I kind of want to steal him
and make him write for TealArt; the scary thing is that I'm only half
kidding about that. We're going to be at the same institution next
school year, which would be cool.

The internet can be a small place sometimes.

I think the ironic definite article is particularly well played here.
don't get your `Strunk and White <http://www.bartleby.com/141/>`__
out and we'll be ok.
