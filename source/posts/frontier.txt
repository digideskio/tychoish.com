I wrote less than 200 words yesterday, but I did a couple of important
things with those words, so I'm not complaining.

They were:

- `I broke the 10k mark on the new
  novel <http://twitter.com/tychoish/statuses/559147112>`__. Lets hope
  I can get the next 15 or even 20 k done in the next month.

- I started the third chapter, and did some associated outlining and
  note taking. These are really independent chapters, and sometimes
  starting a new one can be a bit tough. Good that its over.

Also on the writing front, I read the novella that `I mentioned
yesterday <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/running-in-vr/>`__ last night,
when I was too brain dead to do anything else. (*Note to self: read more
before bed.*) The novella was Alastair Reynolds' "Minla's Flowers," and
I quite enjoyed it. For those of you keeping track at home. In some ways
the story was very much a "first contact/Prime Directive" tale about
interference in lower cultures, and even though we have a succinct way
of categorizing this story, it was fresh and added a good new
perspective to the general model. And on top of that, the really rich
"world" or setting was spectacular.

Though I fear that this makes me sound like a horribly trite SF fan,
there are a couple of more complex appreciations here.

- Somehow I always think that because short form works are, well short,
  that you have to strip away anything that's not The Plot, and The
  Characters, but to be honest, I think *by proportion* this and the
  Wolf 359 story I read the other day, had more "setting" and "world"
  than the long form stuff that I'm working on.
- There's a huge historiographical component to this story, which I
  think is really cool, and makes me seem not so much like a freak in
  some of the stuff that I'd been playing with. But that said, I like
  the way that "cold storage" was used to make this happen, and how the
  short(er) work was able to both sand alone and work in a larger
  framework.

I learned a lot. So I'm happy. Time to make tea and actually get some
stuff done.

Talk with you soon!

Onward and Upward!
