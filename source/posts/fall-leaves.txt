I have an admission to make.

My first novel opened with the scene of a sort of "perfect fall day" *on
Mars.*

That's right. I had oak tree's and grass *on Mars.* It was **that** bad

The other night I had the idea of seeing if I could rescue that story in
a like 2,000 word space opera with a sort of "the bad guys always get
away, but at least we'll always have each other," kind of piece.

Only without the trees this time.
