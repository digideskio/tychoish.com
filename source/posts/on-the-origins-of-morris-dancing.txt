When you're out in the world Morris Dancing, everyone asks what you're
doing. Actually, more typically people ask "What country is this from?"
but I don't know what that means. In any case, this past weekend I
witnessed the following exchange between elderly spectator to the
foreman of a certain New York City Men's Team as the tour was moving
between stands:

**Spectator**: What is this and where is it from?

**J.D.**: It's English Morris Dancing, do you know what that is?

**Spectator**: No.

**J.D.**: Do you care?

**Spectator** (*pauses, unsure of how to continue*) Yes, is it like
cricket or football?

**J.D.** Cricket.

(*At this point the spectator continued about his way satisfied and the
tour continued to the next stand.*)

This exchange, as these usually go, was pretty good. And the cricket
part is totally right. There's actually, as I understand it, a lot of
connection between the history of cricket and Morris Dancing: village's
teams would play cricket and dance Morris, Morris Kits were often
cricket uniforms with ribbons and bells, and before cricket, most Morris
dancers wore black pants.

Still.
