The Hard (GNU/Linux) Truth

**Backstory:** `Chris <http://www.cgkreality.com/>`__ is something of an
Operating system junkie, and likes to play around with things. I think
he's weird, but whatever. Also, he bought a netbook several months ago,
and after much persistence on my part (and some epic failures of Ubuntu
instalations,) he finally installed `Arch
Linux <http://www.archlinux.org/>`__, and it worked amazingly well.
Here's a funny (ok, mildly amusing?) conversation about his latest
system plan with only minor editing for understandability and comedic
value:

**Chris:** I was thinking that I'd move some stuff off of my second
internal hard drive and install the alpha version of Ubuntu to see how
it works.

**tycho:** How it works? Like crap. It's ubuntu, so it's meant to be
easy to install and usable, not fresh, robust, and hardened. Besides its
an *alpha*, if you what stability just install Arch and get it done
with.

**Chris:** [*silence* and *pause*]

**tycho:** now that we resolved this quandary what's next?

**Chris:** [*sighs* and *laughs*] Nothing, really. [*pause*\ ] I'm
downloading Arch now, asshole.

**tycho:** [*laughs*\ ] You're welcome.

I don't actually use Arch, because Ubuntu has been simple and I've yet
to have a problem with it, but I *would* use Arch if I needed it, and I
(seem) to recommend it to all my friends who are *really* geeky and are
having problems with debian/ubuntu.

*shrug*
