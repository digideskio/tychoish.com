Hypertext Roundup

Initially, it seems that the term "hypertext" served as general
classification for any kind of dynamic text with "hyperlinks" (which of
course we just call links these days). In 2007 (as opposed to 1987),
hypertext is ubiquitous, and we're constantly interacting with
hypertexts, to the point that it's just "the web" or "text," and "links"
are assumed to be intuitive at this point. As a result, the main time I
hear someone say hypertext these days, they're artists exploring the
creative possibilities of the medium separate from normal (relaxed?)
text. That wasn't my intention, and thus the reason I said
"hyperdigitaltext," the expressive possibilities aside, I'm interested
in the day-to-day practices of consuming and producing digital-text, and
in a lot of ways, this series is a trip back to the first usages of
hypertext in an attempt to think about might happens next.

Not being, you know, psychic, I'm not sure how successful this project
has been. But in any case, it I have enjoyed the space to think about
these issues, and I hope that you have too. This is just a roundup post,
a sort of directory of the hypertext posts on Tealart for your
referencing pleasures.
