Writing Software Beyond Emacs

The ideal writing application is
`emacs <http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`__, at least for me. In the
absence of emacs (as on a tablet,) I've been thinking about what
features I actually need in a writing application. While I've grown to
admire the power of a full Lisp machine in my text editor, I accept that
it's not, strictly speaking required. Here's a first stab at the list of
requirements. Feel free to comment or submit a patch to this page.

- Simple, primarily full screen editing.
- The ability edit very large files, 100kbs should present no issue.
- Some sort of syntax highlight during the editing process, preferably
  support for LaTeX, Markdown, and org-mode.
- Word count generation for the entire files and for current
  selections.
- Auto-save as crash protection.
- Undo/Redo last typing action.

Nice to have (but not crucial) features:

- The ability to edit one file and reference another (or potentially
  edit) at the same time. Bonus points for being able to switch between
  to parts of a single file at once.
- The ability to hide or collapse some sections of a file.
- Optional spell checking.
- Parenthetical and double-quote matching.
- Soft and hard line/word wrapping.

Other than that I don't think there's anything that I *really* need to
have to get writing done 90% of the time. How about you?
