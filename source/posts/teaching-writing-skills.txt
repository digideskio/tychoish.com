Teaching Writing Skills

All of my friends who have taught composition are appalled when they
hear me say that I want to teach writing. But it's true: I would be
interested in having the opportunity to give people the kind of writing
education that I never got to have. I've even collected a few of these
ideas on a very rough "[[pedagogy]]" page. This post, by contrast, will
be a list of "things I wish I could have learned before I got a job
writing."

- How to write in long form. The skils and process for writing
  something that's a hundred pages is fundamentally different from the
  process for writing pieces that are a few hundred words or a few
  pages. Project management, planning, and organization are totally
  different skills.

- Working with editors. In school, the editing process is very
  conversational. Editors, comment and ask you to make changes if
  agree with their judgment. Writers need to learn how to gather
  requirements, write the best possible content, and then hand it over
  to an editor who will modify the text without comment. Not only is
  it important to learn how to "get over this," but also in how to
  learn from this kind of editing

- How to revise work. While I've learned to avoid making a number of
  mistakes to which I'm particularly prone, and spot those errors when
  the slip through, it's really the process of applying for jobs that
  has taught me how to revise my own writing. Revision is probably the
  hardest writing skill, and I think there are probably better ways to
  teach revision than some sort of idealized "drafting process."

- How to write at volume, even when you're not feeling inspired. We're
  pretty good at teaching people to write when they're inspired or
  have done a lot of research. But writing Writing needs to be as
  instinctive as speech and the kind of thing that you don't need to
  be *inspired* to be able to do. Not because anyone writes *that*
  much, but it's a comfort thing.

- How to document things. Which is to say, how to record a practice,
  wprocedure, or interface, to tell people (and your future self,) how
  to do something. I had to figure this out on my own, and I think
  people would be much better writers for being 10% worse at writing
  essays and 10% better at writing processes.

That would do it! I've included some work in this direction in the
:doc:`pedagogy page </pedagogy>`, but comments, are always
valuable.
