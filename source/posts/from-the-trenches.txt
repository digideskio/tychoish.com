I knew I said that I'd post coda things now that I'm going to bi-weekly
essays, and today would be the first day of the new order and I've
failed. Alas. Today was spent going glaring at my outline and waiting in
doctor's waiting rooms. I did read a `really great
article <http://www.irosf.com/q/zine/article/10519>`__ from `Kristine
Kathryn Rusch <http://www.kristinekathrynrusch.com/>`__ about
recessions, short fiction, and it was pretty inspiring. Go read, and
then read some more. I've also had some interesting
`twitter <http://www.twitter.com/tychoish/>`__ and
`identi.ca <http://www.identi.ca/tychoish>`__ conversations about
`git <http://www.git-scm>`__ and `emacs <http://www.gnu.org/emacs>`__,
which keeps me entertained at least. I've also been trying out new RSS
readers, as I'd really like something that ran locally.
`Canto <http://codezen.org/canto/>`__ seems to be leading the pack, but
I have *so* many feeds at the moment that switching seems onerous, and I
need something that I can sync between multiple machines, so the whole
switch process gives me shivers. Maybe tomorrow. In the mean time, I
think I'm ready to get back to writing actual fiction (forward progress)
in a day or two, if I can get through one or two more *blasted* sections
of this re-outline; which despite the pain, has been really good for my
thinking about the book.

If you were wondering, that *really is* what it's like to be in my head.
And you thought that my *writing* was scatter brained.
