The Care and Feeding of a Writer

"Being a writer," is a strange thing. I've `written about this
before <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/i-am-a-writer/>`__, but there's more
here. I had a conversation with
`Caroline <http://www.aetataureate.com/>`__ about what it means to be a
writer and I thought some of the things we came up with were pretty
good. I hope I've done a sufficient job of capturing what we talked
about.

One of the things that we emphatically agreed upon was the fact that
writing, despite being something that we're all taught to do in school,
as part of being "an educated person" is not something that everyone is
particularly capable of. [1]_ Not that that's a bad thing. Having said
that, because everyone *reads* at least in some capacity, and most
people know *how* to write, when you tell someone "I'm a writer," or you
say something like "I've been working on this novel for about 16
months," you'll get funny looks. Guaranteed.

There are, I think, a few major issues at play here:

1. Because reading is an automatic facility for most people, I'm
convinced that laypeople are very prone to misunderstanding the
amount of work that any given text represents.

I might even go so far as to say, writing is not something that people
automatically think of as "work." I'm going to sit down and spend some
time talking to imaginary people in my head who live on a spaceship a
thousand years hence, in an attempt and hope that I can productively
explore the post-colonial condition in a new and different way, doesn't
sound like it should be hard. But it is, and I think much more difficult
than the kind of writing that I do professionally.

2. Because most writing education focuses on grammar and extensive
reading (which are great things,) the gulf between "people who write"
and "people who don't," is often *not* about writing technically
solid prose or not (despite the fact that in primary and secondary
education, this is the major p). [2]_ Rather, the ability to
understand something (a process, event, or story) in enough detail to
describe with an awareness of an audience is the real challenge.

Indeed when successful, all of the "work" of writing is entirely opaque
to the reader.

3. Writing a text (an article, essay, or story, as opposed to a memo or
message,) is not something that an individual can--or should be
expected--to accomplish independently. You can't tell a writer "go
write this story, and when you get back we'll print it." Editors,
from the person who says "I need you to write this," to the people
who give you feedback as you progress on a project, to the people who
prepare a text for publication. You can't do it alone: there are too
many conflicting interests at play in the writing of any text that
make it challenging for a single person to write alone.

I don't bring these up to complain. Nor do I think the solution to these
problems is to "just give writers a bit more respect." Knowing these
things about writing, I think we could, quite productively, change the
way we educate students to write. It might also, I think lead to some
productive reorganizations of how writers and editors organize
themselves to get "content" produced.

After a while of talking through these ideas, the conversation produced
the following gem, which I simply must share with you:

**caroline**: you know how everyone has a memoir now?

**tycho**: yeah...

**caroline**: you know what I don't care about?

**caroline**: most people's memoirs

Onward and Upward!

.. [1] I'm aware this sentence ended in a preposition. Piss off.

.. [2] I had the longest run of "highest-possible C" grades on my
   papers in high school English, and while I think I might have
   managed to average out to a B, mostly, that always felt like an
   accomplishment.  In a lot of ways, my failure to achieve in high
   school English is probably mostly responsible for the fact that I
   avoided writing almost entirely in college.
