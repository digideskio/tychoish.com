Here's the second half of the tealart winter update. the knitting
savant(s?) is the tealart knitting blog, reborn in a nifty new page.
it's something, sort of like (re)ping id, in terms of site structure
that I've wanted to get done for a while, but never had the brain cells
in the right place. check it out, link to it, and have some fun. I hope
we will....

Oh, and my mother is going to be partaking in the knit blogging as well.
oy. we'll see how that turns out. well I hope. it's a solstice present,
doncha know.
