Television to Knit by
=====================

So I don't in reality watch all that much television, but I do enjoy
knitting and watching TV, particularly whilst sitting in front of the
computer. So I'm compiling a list of shows that I enjoy to knit by.
Don't expect anything ground breaking, sometimes predictable shows are
good for knitting.

1.  Law and Order (All of 'em)
2.  Battlestar Galactica
3.  Shark
4.  Bones
5.  NCIS
6.  Stargate Atlantis
7.  Boston Legal
8.  House
9.  Criminal Minds
10. How I Met Your Mother
11. 30 Rock
12. Jericho
13. Numb3rs
14. Eureka
15. Dexter.

So mostly procedurals, a little bit of science fiction, with a dash of
comedy and drama... Lets note that I don't watch all these shows every
week, nor do I watch these shows with commercials, which makes it
better.

Lets make this a meme, and I tag all of you! If you watch TV and knit,
what shows do you watch. The only rule is that they all must currently
be in production... Link or track-back your post in the comments.
