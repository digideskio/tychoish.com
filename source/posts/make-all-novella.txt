================
Make All Novella
================


(**Note**: *I was going through some old files earlier this week and
found a couple of old posts that never made it into the live site. This
is one of them. I've done a little bit of polishing around the edges,
but this is as much a post for historical interest as is a reflection of
the contemporary state of my thought.*)

When I decided to publish my novella `Knowing
Mars <http://tychogaren.com/mars>`__, I decided that I wanted to use my
`existing publication system <http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/>`__
and that I wanted to automate the process of generating of all the
necessary versions that made it possible to keep my original files in
sync, without needing to duplicate effort. I decided that the few hours
it would take to write a script would both save a lot of time later
*and* make it more likely to maintain the text.

So I have this script that:

- Copies the source files into the publication directory.

- Generates: full html files for every chapter, plain text files for
every chapter, a full html edition of the complete text, a plain text
edition of the complete text, a minimally styled html edition of the
complete text.

- Keeps these editions synchronized.

- Keep the original source files synchronized.

- Ideally provide a tool that would prove useful in the future.

I've included the code of what I came up with in this wiki, at
**[[code/build-novel]]**, and you can find the full source of
`tychogaren.com <http://tychogaren.com>`__ and `Critical
Futures <http://criticalfutures.com>`__
`here <http://git.cyborginstitute.com/?p=criticalfutures.com.git;a=summary>`__.
For the full source of the\ `Knowing Mars
text <http://git.cyborginstitute.com/?p=knowing-mars.git;a=summary>`__
consider the
`gitweb <http://git.cyborginstitute.com/?p=knowing-mars.git;a=summary>`__.
I would be very grateful for any feedback or input.
