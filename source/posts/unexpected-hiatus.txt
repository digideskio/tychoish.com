Hello everyone!

It's really good to be back. As I'm sure you're aware, tealart was out
of service for basically the last week. I've been calling it a hosting
mishap: the details of which are unimportant. There were a few days in
there where we were unsure if we were going to be able to get access to
the site. As you can see, we managed to get everything back the way it
should be: (there are even a few improvements [1]_.) Nevertheless there
were a few moments of doubt in there, and while it was distressing, I
found that I was able to be rather zen about the whole experience. The
interesting thing is that this came at a moment where I was feeling
rather energized about my development as a writer (academically and
otherwise) and also about the progress of tealart and my other
productions.

Having said that, it was a particularly tough week for me in school: I
had one of my more impressive writing marathons, and I think I did much
of the remaining important work of the semester in the span of four or
five days. It's nice to have a little bit of a breather, though, I must
say. And I do think that `twitter <http://www.twitter.com/tychoish>`__
was quite helpful in surviving the bloggless period. And even though the
website was down, I also managed to do a little bit of writing for
TealArt that I hope you'll get to see in the next few weeks.

In addition I did some planning for another TealArt series: this one,
will hopefully not be written (entirely) by myself, and my hope is that
it'll be an experiment in storytelling of some sort. That's the hope at
least, we'll see how it develops.

Anyway, this is supposed to be a short little entry, look for more
substantive content later in the week. For now I will leave you with a
little exchange from a class I was in on Thursday night.

cheers, ty.

**Professor:** Who decides what something means?

**Foucauldian Student:** I think it's up to who ever has political
power.

**Professor:** Why of course! [*appears satisfied with the response,
and there is a brief silence, as the conversation lulls before
starting in a new direction.*\ ]

**Tycho:** but we all read... [*pause*\ ]

**Class** looks quizzically at **Tycho.**

**Tycho:** oh wait, there was a discussion going on in my head that
you all missed out on. sorry folks. *explains reader response theory
at some length*

I was able to get some of the
`AJAX <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX>`__ functionality of the
template to *finally* work, including a more functional commenting
feature, and archive display. Also, as you can see, I found an
enhanced version of markdown for
`Wordpress <http://www.wordpress.org>`__ that supports the tentative
footnote feature, which **rocks**, as you all know.
