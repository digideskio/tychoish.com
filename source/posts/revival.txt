I think I need a new system for titling my "good morning tychoish"
posts, because I'm so going to run out of novel titles. But not yet.

Yesterday was a slow day for some reason, yet to be determined, though I
think I did get a bunch of things done, so maybe all wasn't lost.

In review:

- I went to my parent's dancing class, because they asked.
- I knitting a dozen rows on the sleeve of the morocco sweater.
- Wrote blog posts.
- Worked on a Station Keeping post.
- Planned the rest of the third chapter of breakout.
- Switched email clients to GyazMail.

The fact that I revived station keeping after so long, is really a good
thing in my book. I enjoy writing SK episodes. And I just need to get
back into it more, the serial is something I want to play with for a
while. I'm throwing around the idea of blogging a novel length project
as I do it, but it wouldn't be for a while.

This, I think more than anything, proves that I'm a child of 90s,
because left to my own devices I turn into a performance art junkie.
"Yeah, that's right, lets turn novel writing in to a performance piece."
Brilliant tycho, brilliant. Sigh.

On the email front, you all probably are pretty clear that I have
something of a death feud with Apple's Mail.app. Mostly that it's pretty
slow, and it doesn't handle IMAP in a way even approaching
intelligibility. GyazMail does better on these counts, though I will
admit that I do almost miss the Mail.app multiple account inbox method a
bit.

Anyway, I have writing and other things to do this morning, so time to
get this post out.

Have a great day!

Onward and Upward!
