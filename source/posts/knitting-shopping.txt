*... and planning*

I did a little bit of holiday knitting shopping. Given how
infrequently I buy yarn and knitting things *and* the fact that
shopping for knitting things correlates strongly with my project
planning, it seems worth sharing: 

- I got a cone of merino/tencel lace weight yarn in a steel blue color
  to knit a long plain tube to wear as a neck tube/scarf thing. I
  bought one of these a few months ago knit out of a jersey tencel
  knit, and I adore it, so it makes sense to knit something similar. 
  
  Hopefully knitting these scarves will prove successful and
  useful. I'm not much of a knitted sock wearer, I find most flat
  scarves dreadful to knit, I find shawls difficult to pull off, and I
  enjoy knitted hats but don't find them windproof enough for common 
  use. Having good, small, lightweight, and plain knitting projects
  would probably be very good thing indeed. 
  
- I bought a couple of carbon fiber knitting needles, in sizes 2.5
  (the size that my sweaters have been and will be for a little
  while,) and 0s (for the scarfs and hem facings as needed.) 
  
  I'm a chronic needle bender and like sharp points and reasonably
  slippery needles. I also have a set of carbon fiber needles for socks
  which are great. Very much looking forward to trying these out. 

- Finally, I've procured a few cones of HD Shetland to complement some
  of my left overs. On the sweater queue: 
  
  - a few cardigans. One for my mother, and a second one for me?
  
  - maybe something with shoulders/sleeves in a different color? I've
    used this kind of shading on otherwise plain sweaters, but it
    seems interesting to see how it might look on a two color
    sweater.
