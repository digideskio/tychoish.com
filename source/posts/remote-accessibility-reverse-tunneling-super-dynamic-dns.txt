I have a question for my system administrator readers. And maybe the
rest of you as well.

I run a web server on my laptop that hosts about 8 test sites. Nothing
special: mostly test and development sites for various public sites, but
from time to time I think, "shit, wouldn't it be nice if I could just
give someone a link to this." My solution is generally to copy whatever
it is that I'm working on up to the server that runs this website, and
while that generally work just fine, *it could be better.*

So here's what I'm thinking:

I'd like to be able to hook my laptop up to the internet and be able to
let people access (some) of the content running on this web server. I
don't want it to be automatic, or open my entire machine to the world
(though... I could secure it, I suppose.) The options I've considered.

- I set up a VPN that I can connect to the public server (that hosts
  this website) from the laptop, and I have a virtual host (or set of
  virtual hosts) that proxy requests to the laptop. Wherever I am, it
  works. I'm not worried about the bandwidth or the strain on the
  server given the usage pattern I'm expecting.

  - Pros: Simple, Secure, works even if I'm on a weird local network.
    Potentially useful for other kinds of nifty hacking including
    tunneling all traffic through the VPN on insecure connections.

  - Cons: Way complex, and I'm not sure if it will work. I'll need to set
    up VPN software. And it's total overkill.

- Some sort of scripted dynamic DNS solution, probably involving
  running my own DNS server.

  - Pros: less proxy madness. Pretty simple.

  - Cons: running a DNS server. Won't work on some (most) local networks.

- There has to be some sort of alternate approach using a minimalist
  tunneling solution. There are a few of them, I think they're nifty,
  and it would probably be *perfect*. I'm just not sure what it is.

  ...and then half the night later, I finished deploying the VPN. I have
  to say that I'm really pleased with it:

- It can (and has) replaced my ssh tunnels for sending email. That's
  pretty great.

- The web server stuff works, though I don't have anything really up
  there yet. I feel like I need some sort of access restriction method,
  but I don't really like any of the options. HTTP Auth is annoying
  rather than protective, SSL is terribly imperfect and fussy, host
  based control isn't very tight.

- I think I will be able to *finally* sacrifice a laptop to the
  "homeserver" because aside from dis/re-enabling the "sleep on laptop
  close" function. If needed it'll be dead simple to convert a sever
  laptop to a mobile laptop.

Thoughts?
