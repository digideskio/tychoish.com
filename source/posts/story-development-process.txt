Story Development Process

In debates between writers who outline voraciously and writers who "just
write" and think that outlining kills the energy of a project, I usually
come down on the side of the outliners. If I make an outline, even if I
don't hold myself to it closely, I tend to be more focused and run into
fewer snags than if I fly by the seat of my pants. Except...

Except that I'm *horrible* about outlining characters and to a lesser
extent settings. I swear if any of my stories were ever performed on
stage, it'd be a clear stage except for a background mural vaguely
reminiscent of space. And while I tend to have a pretty clear idea of
what's going on in terms of "what happens next" I fly by the seat of my
pants *every inch of the way* in terms of characters.

The good news is that I'm pretty good with character representation and
dialogue (that psychology major paying off after all?), so I can fake it
well. The bad news is that I don't often don't realize that I don't have
a clue what I'm doing until embarrassingly late in the game.

As I was thinking about this last weekend (and forcing myself to write
character sketches,) I realized a few things:

1. I suspect that most people who "fly by the seat of their pants"
probably do some character development, and that just as I have given
myself personal dispensation for *not* making notes about characters,
I think that they probably do the same *for* making these notes. It's
interesting at any rate.
2. It's really helpful to make notes about characters to help keep them
consistent over the course of a writing project. Duh.
3. My tendency is to make characters too realistic. Characters in
stories need to be in great danger, they need to have problems that
they can't think their way out of, and they need to be faced with
situations that might radically change the face their world, if not
the world itself. The truth is that most of our problems *are things*
we can think our way out of (that would be the *downside* of the
psychology major) and we pass through our lives with only routine
levels of danger, and almost all of the situations we experience are
alone unlikely to change the world.

Anyway I have some characters to go sketch out...
