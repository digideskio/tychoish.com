The Left Hand of Reading Report

I finished, at last, *The Left Hand of Darkness,* the canonical novel by
Urusla K. LeGuin.

Even though I'm not in school any more and thus don't have that as an
excuse, I'm still a tragically slow reader, this is one thing among many
which I hope to get much better at.

Anyway, the book. I loved it. Both because the story was good, and
because the gender thing was clever and neat (at least for 300 pages),
and probably most importantly because it is such a clever example of
ethnography. I like the way that it is able to evoke that genre and
style so effectively.

So what's next on the reading list?

Melissa Scott's *The Jazz*.

I've often thought about (sometimes even here on tychoish) about
cyberpunk, and sort of the next thing in this "intellectual tradition,"
and I think about people like Cory Doctorow, or what William Gibson has
done in the last ten years, and I'm underwhelmed. The wonder, the
adventure (which is often exchanged for 'thril[ler]'), and the way that
the genre initially dealt with class are all gone.

And then I read the first 25 pages of *The Jazz*, and I realized that
cyberpunk is in fact, not dead. Not impossible in the post 2001 world.

And I am happy.
