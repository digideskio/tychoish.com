tightening outlines #2

I'm a big fan of outlines. I wrote `this post about tightening
outlines <http://tychoish.com/posts/tightening-outlinestightening-outlines>`__
about my approach to *making outlines better* that I've been using most
recently. This post, in turn is more about execution.

The issue, that I think causes a lot of people to be *less* into
outlines, is the fact that outlines sort of dreary to write from. Which
is to say, that the cool thing about writing (for me at least) is the
feeling I get when I immerse myself in a world and characters' and I'm
able to record the feeling of that experience. When it works that's
really satisfying, and while I don't think it's required for "being a
writer," it is certainly nice when it happens.

I suspect I'm not alone in finding this aspect of writing to be
pleasurable and the thing about it is, of course, that it's hard to both
"slipstream" into the writing world and also follow your outline. The
end result is that while I'm pretty rigorous about creating my outlines
I'm not particularly rigorous about *following* my outlines.

This isn't, as far as I'm concerned, a bad thing. For a couple of
reasons.

1. The act of creating an outline is useful onto itself. It walks you
through the story once so you know what's going on, and you can
figure out or avoid writing yourself into corners. Also the more
familiar you are with *the whole story* when you start writing at the
beginning, the less likely you are to have a story that takes a few
chapters to "get off the ground."

2. If you review your outline sporadically while you're writing, you'll
probably be able to recall the important memories of "what you were
thinking when you wrote that part of the outline, and then and be
able to get to that part of the story, and write from there. You
needed follow what you said in the outline very closely--lots of
great ideas come up when you write, but having a road map makes it
harder to get lost.

--------------

Ok, that's what I keep telling myself. The truth is that I've been
toiling in chapters 4 and 5 of this novel for a few weeks now, and my
outline isn't doing me a lot of good. And at least on number two above,
I've not been very good at keeping up with my outline.

I'm not even sure how to articulate my issue with the story at this
point. Part of the issue, is that I juggled some scenes around in
chapter three that required pushing a few other things back, and having
been thrown off the rails, it's hard to figure out the pacing of what
I'm trying to do *right now*. I think that gets it pretty closely.

So I'm going to spend some time this week, taking a bit of a breather
from working on the actual text, and working on doing a little more
outlining, and work on other projects, so I feel a little bit *less*
like I'm grasping around in the dark.

Because I'm nothing if not reasonable.

Onward and Upward!
