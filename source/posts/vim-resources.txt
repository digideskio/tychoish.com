Vim Resources

So, folks, in an effort to provide a service to the community rather
than simply nattering on about my neuroses, I thought that I would
provide a list vim resources that you might all find helpful on your own
journeys with vim.

Just a refresher: VIM is a super old school, super powerful text editor
that I'm in a battle to learn. For people who live and breath text, this
is sort of the *ergonomic* "leather man tool" to end all such tools.

It's all below the fold...

These are just documentation sources, not GUI layers and what not, which
I also recommend you look into if you're going to be a serious VIM user.
VIM works pretty well in a command line (its native environment) but the
GUI is most helpful in letting VIM interact with your other
applications, as it almost certainly will need to. `Cream for
VIM <http://cream.sourceforge.net/>`__ works great for linux, I've not
tested it for windows (but I suspect that it's pretty good), and its
downright sucky for Mac. `MacVim <http://code.google.com/p/macvim/>`__
is remarkably good, but needs some performance enhancing before I think
it's really viable, particularly on older machines. The issue with this
is that the more official `gvim <http://www.vim.org/>`__ package is
written in an outdated environment for OS X, but is generally acceptable
for windows and linux, so it's fine. Anyway. onto the resource.

-  `dotfiles <http://www.dotfiles.org>`__ - Dotfiles is a collection of
users' unix preferences and setting files. It's really useful if
you're getting into seriously using the shell
(.bashrc/.bash\_profile, .zshrc, etc.) or other unix-ish tools like
Mutt and vim to see what most people are doing to customize the
program. Most of these programs seem painfully difficult only because
everyone who uses them has customized them to within an inch of their
lives.
-  `vim tips <http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/>`__ - A great wikia wiki (the
private/for profit wiki hosting project by the people who do
wikipedia.) It collects little bits of nagging "how on earth do you
do x" and usually there's an answer.
-  `vi editor 101 <http://www.marchansen.com/tn101/>`__ - This is the
website guide that has all of the vim answers. All of them. It's not
cleverly or usefully organized so you have to grep through it, but
other wise it's quite useful.
-  `Editing in vim <http://jmcpherson.org/editing.html>`__ - This is the
cheat sheet/guide that I find myself turning to more than any other
when I forget how to do something that I should know reflexively. And
the page is well designed and well laid out.
-  `vim for textmate
fans <http://alexyoung.org/articles/show/12/vim_for_textmate_fans>`__
- If you, like me, have experience with the amazing
`TextMate <http://macromates.com/>`__ editor, and want some help
making the vim transition this is a good place to start, and even if
your not there are a couple of vim tips that I think many will enjoy.
