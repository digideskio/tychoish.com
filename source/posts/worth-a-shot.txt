well the blogmate thing totally didn't work out.

`MarsEdit <http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/>`__ for the win.

I have to say that I'm a better blogger (ie. I link more) when in
textmate where there's a key command to link a selected phrase to the
first google result for that selected phrase. It's awesome!

anyway, back to "real" work
