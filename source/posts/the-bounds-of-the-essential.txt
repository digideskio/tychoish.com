===========================
The Bounds of the Essential
===========================

After an argument with Heather last night, I find myself asking, where
the line is, in regards to essentialism, and essentialist formulations
of gender and sex.

I offer you a quote: > "'man' and 'woman' are fictions, caricatures,
cultural constructs" and that "we are . . . a multisexed species."

I'll offer reference upon request... but it's surprising at least to me.

Monique Wittig, also (very much in the tradition of Simone de Beauvior)
offers a similar statement that locates the notion of "woman" and "man"
(as well as "lesbian") as being historically and contextually
meaningful.

Are these people off the hook? I mean, if you put the post-structrual
disclaimer in, does that in some way de-essentialize the argument?
Perhaps is there a way to say, this kind of argument may not actually
essentialize identity completely, but leads to essentialism?

Can/do post-structuralists essentialize identity still/too? Is that
splitting hairs?

If so, and even if not, is identity and collective identity still a
meaningful site of analysis? I mean I certainly think that identity
groups are meaningful and helpful, but at the same time, it's a huge can
of worms....

Just some thinking Cheers, sam
