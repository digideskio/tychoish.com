The Kindle and Digital Distribution
===================================

I was reading `this article in review of the
kindle <http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/06/random-thoughts.html>`__
and I had a couple of thoughts about digital distribution and
media. [1]_ Now of course, I'm pretty sure that the Kindle is *not* the
end all device for digital text, but I think it gets a lot of things
right, and is a good development for technology. Some thoughts:

Reasons the Kindle is a Failure
-------------------------------

- DRM. If you're not allowing people full access to their files in open
formats your not really selling the books. Period. This is a hugely
ideological complaint, but here the impact: the prices are too high
given that they're not *really* selling you the book.
- Given the above, I think 5 dollars (half of what they charge you now)
is probably the most they could reasonably charge for a book and
likely something within a dollar of $2 USD is probably ideal. Mass
Market paperbacks are 7 bucks, which is lower than the ten that an
ebook. More on pricing.
- The device is overpriced *and* they nickel and dime you to death for
service. Getting books/texts converted cost 10 cents. Certain RSS
feeds cost recurring fees. I think either they have to subsidize the
price of the device and then have a service contract (that includes
credits for a given number of books, possibly tied to amazon prime?)
or keep the price of the device high and really give the service away
for free.
- The obligatory complaints about the objects design and interface.

Reasons the (right) next "Kindle" could be amazing.
---------------------------------------------------

- If they fix the price/DRM/etc. problem, sales go up, total revenue
goes up, it's more successful.
- Given the always on internet, people buy a kindle book for different
reasons then they buy a regular book: You buy a kindle book because
you have time, you've read the first couple of sample chapters and
you want to read more. You buy a dead tree book because you see it on
the shelf and you think you might enjoy reading it later on. I have
lots of print books in my collection that I've not read. I think
you're probably less likely to collect digital books in the same way.
- Digital distribution does away with overstock, and most distribution
costs, which means the reasonable limitations on publication becomes
editorial/production staff time, and available good
manuscripts. [2]_. This doesn't mean that there won't be codices
anymore, they just won't be produced in the same way, and they won't
be bought and sold in the same way.
- If this or some sort of digital reading device becomes more
ubiquitous (and cheaper and therefore more accessible to a greater
segment of the population,) such a device could be the main way that
we we do a lot of our reading of text, and I think it isn't hard to
imagine a revival of greater interest in book length forms as result
of the proliferation of such a device.

Just a few thoughts at any rate.

As an aside I think it's fascinating the way that the author of that
post connects (rightly I suspect) the marketing of Kindle to women
(though the links are loose, I think chicklit/"pop fiction" is sort
of the ideal material for this sort of device) rather than to the
typical (male) geeky early adopter types. I think this is
fascinating, but it's not

A digression on the costs of traditional publishing: It probably
costs 15 bucks to make a high quality hardcover that sells for 25
dollars; so that leaves 10 dollars between the seller (I think markup
for books is 35% of the cover price) and the author/publisher so were
talking about a few bucks **at best**. Mass market and trade
paperbacks have even *lower* margins.
