I caved yesterday and bought roving. Hand dyed roving at that. This
entry is about various developments in my slate of projects.

Given that I had, basically none of my own fiber in the house [1]_, and
that I get a hefty discount on stuff at the yarn shop I've been working
at, and the fact that this fiber has been sitting on the shelf staring
me down for weeks, and so I got it. The color name is Blueberries and
Cream, it's Merino, I got 8 ounces. Wait, I've found a picture that I'm
stealing from the `companies
website <http://www.stonebarnfibers.com/>`__

I think the blues are a little bit brighter in real life, but that's
pretty clearly a flash effect.

Anyway this morning I spun the first third of the roving. My plan is to
have a DK/Sprt weight 3 ply. The first strand I'm broke the colors up
pretty well and spun them in the order that they came on the roving. The
next strand I'm going to intentionally mix up the colors, and the third
strand I'm going to figure something else to do, I might break up the
fiber and then spin a regular sequence, but we'll see.

My hope is that I'll be finishing up the plying right as my shetland
roving arrives. I hope the spin that the same way as this (3ply DK/Sport
weight,) even though it's all one color.

Also, I've finally reached the point in the Latvian mitten Sweater where
I have to unzip the provisional cast-on and knit the hem facing. Ugg.
This is a two-or-so inch long piece of fabric that is... 110 inches
wide. It has to go up and down the cardigan opening, around the neck
opening, and all the way around the bottom edge of the sweater. This is
the third sweater where I've had to do this massively annoying procedure
to this year. And while I've been leaning towards not doing cardigans
for a while, I'm swearing them off for the next several garments.

But because the knitting is so tedious, and so large (because of course
the *whole damn thing* has to fit in your bookbag/lap, it's not really
feasible to work on this "here and there" like you might with most
knitting. Anyway, because of this, I've cast on for the ribbing of my
next sweater.

I reason that this is acceptable because:

- I hate knitting corrugated ribbing.

- I haven't chosen the charts/pattern for the body of the sweater, just
the stitch count.

- If I cast on now, I won't be tempted to turn the border into some
sort of provisional cast-on that will require unzipping/hemming
later. Judge for yourself.

I have, what probably amounts to about a pound of roving, part of it
is a dyed-black merino, and the other part is a merino/tencel (blue)
that I was spinning a year ago when I took a break from spinning.
It's a two ply bulky, and it's hibernating because I have no clue
what I want to do with the yarn anymore, and I have a lot of this
fiber already spun, and I can't decide what to do with it. So it
doesn't count.
