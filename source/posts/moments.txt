I should hear from graduate school this week. Wow.

I've been knitting my on the sleeve pretty intently for the last couple
of days. Not working on the sock. I have two pattern repeats done, of
six, before the final 74 row pattern repeat. In other words, I'm nowhere
near done, but I'm making progress, and this first little bit is always
difficult because there are so many stitches. I've already decreased,
for instance, 42 stitches. My hope is to get another 12-20 stitches
decreased today.

Slowly but surely.

I also thought my way though my next knitting pattern. While I had been
thinking that I would knit a drop shouldered v-neck pull-over, because I
wanted to knit something that I thought I could reliably wear, I'm
thinking that I'm going to knit a zipper cardigan, in a
recreation/alteration of a sweater that I made about a year ago. And I
thought that I'd do it after Meg Swansen's "Saddle Shoulder Aran
Cardigan," except, you know, in color work. It means doing the sleeves
from the cuff, upwards.

I'm looking forward to this, and I think that having a more concrete
design goal in mind makes finishing up this project more enticing.

And I want to get through some of my spinning in the next couple of
days/weeks, I did a little wheel spinning today, and I have some drop
spindle to wind off, and there are errands, and what not. Oh, I set the
twist in a couple skeins that I spun earlier this season, and they are
quite nice, in their own way.

And that's most of the news that's fit to sing.

Onward and Upward!
