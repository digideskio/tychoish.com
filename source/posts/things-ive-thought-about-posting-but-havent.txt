Here's a list of "things I've thought about posting about, but haven't"
this weekend. I know it's been slow around here, uncharacteristically
slow, but all is well, and I'm actually feeling pretty good.

- Current frustrations with knitting projects

- Switches and cylces through my projects
- Greif about sleeves
- Greif about planning next sweater's armhomes

- My huge knitting class which had 10 people in it.
- Thoughts on money and budgeting said money
- Thoughts on OmniFocus and changing my "system" around, and how this
is a pretty habitual thing for me.
- Thoughts on selling sweaters and other knitted things.
- Thoughts on my failure to read things seriously
- Impostor syndrome and pseudonyms
- Macworld
