**Andy:** You know we've never talked on the phone.

**tycho:** yes, blessedly. Don't take this personally but the phone is
overrated, and I assure you that I'm a real person.

**Andy:** Yeah, I don't really like the phone either.

**tycho:** no the truth is that I hate the phone with an undying
passion.

**Andy:** I gesture and make faces when I talk on the phone--which is
just fucking ridiculous and makes me look like an ass.

**tycho:** --and perhaps the biggest problem is that I have trouble
talking on the phone when I think people can see or hear me: because
it's so wierd "yes let me talk into this plastic thing to someone who
isn't there..." I mean dude it wasn't too long ago that that sort of
behavior could get you locked up.

**Andy:** A very valid point you make, sir.

**tycho:** ... and I think if I was going to be guilty of some sort of
historical crime I'd much rather it be sodomy...

**Andy:** Amen.
