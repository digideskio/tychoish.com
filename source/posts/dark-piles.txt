For the last 9 years or so, I've kept a copy of a novel that I wrote
during my junior year of high school. It's so crappy, I haven't
brought myself to even unzip the binder that it's printed. I think I
have a Word 95 file of it somewhere, but it mainly exists in paper
form. 

It's so bad folks. So bad. A few years back I reread the prologue,
because of course it had a prologue, in order to rip off a few things
for a different, only slightly less terrible story. Other than that
I've basically been unable to bring myself to even read the damn
thing. The plotting isn't particularly inventive, the characters are
juvenile, and the settings are bland.

I realized the other day that it's like all of those shell scripts
that I wrote when I was learning to program that are hundreds of lines
long, that intermingle argument parsing with actual logic, with
horrible no-abstracted data structures and access patterns, and
implementations that are neither clear nor efficient.

There's also the two hundred thousand words of total crap that I wrote
for my last job. And another couple of un-salvageable fiction projects
that I didn't even bother to print. Even with my current job, I
sometimes come across awful paragraphs that I know that I must have
written a few years ago, but completely fail to understand what I was
thinking.

We all, probably (hopefully!) have things like this in our own
lives. I spent a long time feeling like these concrete examples of my
ineptitude were a burden, a body of work that I had to revise before
I could make progress on new projects.

Untrue. 

I learned a lot from writing these crappy pieces of code, the failed
stories, and terrible pieces of work product. Furthermore all of the
work I've done in these areas since producing the terrible dark piles,
has been better, and continues to get better. 

Embedded in the idea that these dark piles are a burden is the idea
that the production of text, of code is difficult, challenging, and
the majority work. But this isn't true. The work is in figuring out
the interfaces, the implementation, figuring out the structure and
flow of ideas through a system of functions or paragraphs. Typing it
all out is the easy and fun part. It is, of course, important to
revise and polish work, but sometimes it's enough to learn from your
mistakes, to remind ourselves of our progress, and move on.

More than anything, I am thankful.
