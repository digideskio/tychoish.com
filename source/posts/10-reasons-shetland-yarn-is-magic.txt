*This is my last, regularly scheduled weekly knitting essay. The
remainder of the knitting content on TealArt, at least for the
foreseeable will be either project reports, or quick notes, or other
similar pieces. I've started to feel like the knitting content is a bit
tried, and isn't really reflecting what I or you are interested in
reading, very much. But I hope you enjoy this little homage to Shetland
Jumper Weight yarn. -- ty*

I want to tell you a secret: Shetland sheep are magic creatures to be
feared and revered.

"Shetland?!?!" you ask in amazement. "Isn't Shetland yarn rough and hard
to work with?"

Why yes, indeed they are magic, and while you might think that it is
rough, I'm here to explore why you may have the wrong idea about the
shetland sheeps [1]_. In the style of the meaningless top x-number list
that is so popular with the folks at digg, this post will be in a list
format. So there.

1. Shetland not really as rough as you think it is.

   Shetland yarns and wool isn't cashmere, quiviet, or even merino
   yarn, and when people feel shetland yarn it doesn't feel
   comfortingly soft like like luxury yarns, that's true. Shetland's
   magic is that when you put it near your skin, it doesn't
   irritate. This is because shetland yarn doesn't have guard hairs
   like some other yarns, so it isn't prickly, and feels comfortable
   as you where it. This isn't to say that I'd recommend making an
   unlined-skin-tight cat-suit out of shetland, but for most wear
   situation, you'll feel comfortable. In the equation is the fact
   that shetland tends to be (I believe) woolen spun, this means
   that--among other things that the wool is lofty and light. So not
   only does the yarn not attack you, it doesn't weigh you down, and
   magically keeps your warm. What more could you want out of yarn.
   
2. Shetland yarns are available,

   While most yarn stores don't stock a full range of shetland
   colors, the three major suppliers/mills for shetland yarn
   (`Jamieson's <http://jamiesonsshetland.co.uk/jamiesons/>`__,
   `Jamieson's and
   Smith <http://www.shetland-wool-brokers.zetnet.co.uk/>`__, and
   `Harrisville Designs <http://www.harrisville.com/>`__) are
   generally incredibly available, either directly from the mills,
   or from third-party stores. Since these yarns are incredibly
   consistent, once you have a color card and idea about what you
   want, ordering these yarns is really easy.
   
3. Shetland 2-ply is incredibly versatile.

   People's first response to seeing 2 ply shetland is often to say
   that it's too fine. And it is fine yarn, but there are a lot of
   things that you can do with 2-ply. For instance you can: knit
   lace work, knit socks at sock-gauge, knit stranded work, or even
   double the yarn for something a little heftier. Also HD, at
   least, makes a dk/worsted that's double weight yarn, if you
   really can't cope with the fingering weight.
   
4. Shetland has the best color selection around.

   Because of I think that a lot of shetland mills, HD in
   particular, generally produce for weavers (and fair isle
   knitters) there are just more colors around for this kind of
   yarn. It's great.

5. Shetland wears well.

   I think that Shetland wears particularly well because of the
   properties that I mentioned in number 1. It's lofty and tends to
   fairly firmly spun, and all of the mills mentioned above are just
   good. That kind of thing matters.

6. Shetland felts well.

   Shetland, because it's so lofty, and because it's magic felts
   well. This means that it steeks well, and that the fabric wears
   really well and tends to find your body shape and form to it.
   This means that you have to be careful when washing this fabric.
   It also steeks well as the yarn almost felts from the sweat and
   friction from your hands as you knit it. This is one of the great
   joys of this yarn.

7. Shetland Actually Knits at Sport-Weight Gauge

   I can't explain this one at all, but I know it's true. I keep
   looking at the shetland and expecting the gauge to be about what
   I get for other fingering-weight yarn. When I cast on for
   projects expecting this gauge (yes, I'm a strict-non-swatcher),
   it's always too big. When I try and trick the yarn, and pretend
   it's sport weight and cast on with this assumption, it almost
   always works. This goes for situations where I've tried to knit
   both both stranded and plain. I have no good explanation other
   than magic.

8. Shetland Stranded stitches are actually square.

   This is actually an observation of `Meg Swansen and
   EZ <http://schoolhousepress.com/>`__, because even though it's
   not true, I tend to assume this of all color work knitting, and
   its usually pretty close. It's even closer with Shetland, though.
   This makes picking up around armholes particularly fun, and it
   makes it easier to design using charts.

9. Shetland yarn lets you be more frugal with yarn.

   Ok, this might strike you as unlikely, given the fact that
   shetland is perhaps not the most inexpensive yarn around. But
   it's true. The fact is that shetland yarn is pretty standard, I
   mean sure, HD is a microd [2]_ finer than Jameisons and J&S, but
   they're all close. `Also as with any yarn, if you're using the
   same kind of yarn for more than one
   project <http://tychoish.com/posts/yarn-frugality/>`__, it's
   easier to use leftovers.

10. Shetland doesn't pill like merino and other yarns.

    You're right, I'm stretching for a number 10, because I think
    this technically should fit under "wearing well," but it stands
    that shetland doesn't really pill because of the way it's spun
    and the way it tends to felt. Shetland doesn't pill and seems to
    wear like iron. This is a good property in yarn. In contrast,
    I've yet to find a merino that doesn't pill.
    
I hope these were insightful and fun. Questions? Comments? Thoughts? I'd
love to hear them!

Cheers, tycho

   area, because unlike most of the errors on this site, it is indeed
