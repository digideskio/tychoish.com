It's come to my attention (thank you, mother dearest) that the TealArt
commenting software is not working as it should. As I get ready to start
pod-casting, this is going to the top of my list of things to work on.

I have recently, augmented Wordpress (my delightful back-end software
package), in order too accept the pod-cast more graciously. I also
cleaned off the web-space a little so I should be able to get underway
before I run out of space completely. I've also drawn up notes for the
test episode, that would of course be (Episode 0).

I want to have a little segment that I can read, I'm thinking one of the
short stories I wrote before/durring the circle games draft. Not the
horror one (g-d, what was I thinking?), but the protest-y one. It has a
line that refers to a few people as "would-be spider-men," which I was
always particularly fond of. And while, it's not Circle Games proper, it
could be. So much of the world/'verse, is sort of temporally
non-descript, which is why I like it, and why I hope others will too.

Anyway, I want most of my discussion of CG to be in the pod-cast, so
there won't be a lot of chatter regarding it here. One of the things I'm
working on for the proper first episode is a creative commons license
for circle games, likely of the attribution-share-alike variety, but I
need to think through how that will work.

And that's about all I have for now. I'll keep in touch, but now I have
to fix the commenting. And find a blasted pair of headphones which work.

Cheers, sam
