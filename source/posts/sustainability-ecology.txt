Here's another in the train of posts about economics and sustainability.
I started with meditations on `cooperatives, and
openness <http:///tychoish.com/posts/coops-competition-openness/>`__
and `martian
economics <http:///tychoish.com/posts/martian-economics/>`__, and then
`business in network
service <http:///tychoish.com/posts/free-network-businesses/>`__. And
finally, `a brief thought on the state of contemporary
marriage <http:///tychoish.com/posts/co-op-marriage>`__. This post
takes a step back so that I can talk about what I mean by
sustainability, which I think requires a bit of a sidestep into thinking
about ecology and the environment.

Sustainability, as I've come to think about it seems to be more about
directing economic activity toward independence, an self sufficiency
rather than toward "growth," (the for-profit model) and
charitable/philanthropic goals (the non-profit model).

No sooner do I say this, and I realize that being a proponent of
sustainable approaches to economics makes me seem like something of an
economic isolationist, and I think that's the wrong direction. The
problem with sustainability isn't just that it's hard to accomplish in
pragmatic terms, but also hard to think about. We simply don't have
structures or models for people and groups who want to make an honest
living creating new things (eg. fiction, computers, cabinets, software,
agriculture/comestibles, pharmaceuticals, plumbing, newspapers, etc).

Sure, we know how to make things, and most of us manage to make a living
at it, but our economic models rely on lots of growth and expansion in
order for capital to be available (cite: current economic crisis). The
missing piece--it seems to me--is a more systems-based approach to
economic development and corporate organization.

Sustainability is, after all, an ecological idea and in this context.
And discussions of the environment and ecology seem way more focused on
sentimentality, hydrocarbon intput/output, and humanity's impact on the
environment in the context of our existing (non sustainable) business
practices and not enough time thinking about our business practices in
environmental terms. But taking an "ecological" approach to economics
signifies (in my mind) attention to the economy as a whole, and
sustainability as a practice, and that seems like it would be a good
thing.

In the `Mars books (which have been quite influential in this
series) <http://tychoish.com/posts/martian-economics/>`__ a few
characters float the notion of an "eco-economics" where currency (such
as it exists), are based on caloric input and output. Which is a nifty
way to think about it. The strongest part of the martian government
(near the end of the series) is a regulatory "environmental court" that
attempts to manage the ecological/economical activities on a global
scale. They're reasonably effective at this.

I return the Mars books because they're fresh in my mind, and because
they present a possibility that's both radically different from our
current system *and* that attends to the weight of our history. I don't
think that the Robinson-Mars solution is the answer to our economic
problems but it does force us to say "20th centry growth-levels are
unsustainable, and undesirable," and that "from a systems-based approach
(if no other) capitalism is unstable." And that's a useful thought
exercise.

As is the project of thinking about economics in environmental terms.
Not because it will diminish human impact on ecologies--though it
may--but because that sort of systems approach will lead to more
sustainable economies and better lives for all parties to that
activity--human and environmental.

That's a worthwhile goal.
