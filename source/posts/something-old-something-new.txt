In a lot of ways, I've already written this entry
`here <http://tychoish.com/home/>`__, but I feel like it's still
worthwhile for me to write something more definite here.

As you know, from `posts like
this <http://tychoish.com/posts/comparison-tealart-and-tychoish/>`__
I've been, well, agnsty about moving forward with TealArt, as the
demands on my time changes, and my interests and energies shift. I've
thought about inviting other editors/contributors as a way of keeping
the site alive as I take a step back. Alas, I think that this isn't the
kind of approach that's called for. So starting this week *there won't
be TealArt posts on a regular four to five times a week schedule*.

This doesn't mean that TealArt is over. Far from it. Simply, rather than
be a publication in it's own right, TealArt will become more of a
clearing house--and umbrella organization for a number of really cool
projects. `~/tychoish <http://tychoish.com/>`__ is one of those
projects, as is `Station Keeping <http://tychoish.com/hanm/>`__, and the
blog that chris is going to be starting in the next few days will be
part of the TealArt project.

By going to http://tychoish.com/ you'll be able to stay up to date with
all these projects, and though I can't promise that it'll be terribly
interesting on a daily basis, http://tychoish.com/log/ will be (more or
less) the same TealArt that you've come to know and love lo these six or
so years.

I look forward to seeing you in cyberspace, and I do hope that we'll
still be on your radar when Station Keeping starts again, for season 2
in a few weeks.

As always, stay tuned (particularly to the `home
page <http://tychoish.com>`__ and to `tychoish <http://tychoish.com>`__)
and be well.

I'll see you around.

Cheers, tycho
