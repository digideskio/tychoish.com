So I went to this "Podcamp" in Philadelphia a few weeks ago. I'm a huge
fan of getting together with geeks outside of the Internet (in real
life!) to talk about the technology, communities, and practices (let
alone skills and ticks). Indeed meeting people in the real world, is
often a great way to advance and promote whatever it is you're doing on
the Internet, but beyond I often find the experience of having "really
geeky" conversations with people in real life to be rather refreshing.
So much of the geeky things we (I?) do are pretty solitary tasks, and
it's fun to have space and time with other people who *get it*.

On this premise I went to this podcamp thing. I went to a BarCamp last
year that I enjoyed a great deal but I was somewhat intimidated by the
*flock* of staff members from the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (ok, so there were only two. or three. In a small room. Oh,
and a guy who signed the `Agile
Manifesto <http://agilemanifesto.org/>`__. Right.) And while it was
great, and I learned a ton of stuff... I'm a writer, and an a critic,
and not exactly a programmer, and while I write about programmers and
technology *a lot* I think it might be useful--sometimes--to have
separate conversations.

Right? That sounds reasonable.

So here's the thing about Podcamp. Well the thing\ *s*:

- New media isn't anymore. Sure its still a useful distinction given
  that the "old media" (e.g. book publishing, magazines, newspapers,
  network television, and radio) are still around. Indeed they remain
  an incredibly relevant component of the "media ecosystem" both
  globally but also online. Having said that "new media" like social
  media, podcasts, and the like have been around for 4-5 years at this
  point, and it's mostly mainstream now: old media like NPR
  consistently tops the iTunes podcast charts, CNN is on twitter. and
  so forth. And lets not even get started about blogging.

- On the frontier of any new media, anyone who is stubborn enough and
  the first person to stake out a claim to a niche has a pretty good
  chance of finding success. Four years later or more, success is
  something that's much more difficult to parse or assure.

- The `Search engine marketing *thing*, hasn't, as I would have hoped,
  died in a fiery and epic
  death <http://tychoish.com/posts/seo-nonsense/>`__. This shit is
  all over the place, and everyone seems to be talking about
  pay-per-click advertising and not the fact that what *really* matters
  is word-of-mouth. I'm so incredibly frustrated by all the crap that
  gets generated both in sport of "SEO" and in service of it as well.

  *I can tell when you write articles that are designed to get voted up on
  reddit and digg, and I throw up in my mouth a little when I see them.*

  I got through a day of that, and I couldn't cope with any more.

- Everyone was talking about how to promote a venture, and how to do
  marketing in "*this brave new world we're in,*\ " but no one was
  really talking about how to develop and *make* something online that
  works. The marketing thing takes works and there are a couple of
  non-obvious aspects of the marketing effort, but it's not rocket
  science. Sometimes, figuring out what is likely to work online and
  how to present things in an effective way is by far the largest
  challenge.

- I'm not sure that hybrid-un/conferences work. And I'm pretty sure
  that the space didn't work. Unconferneces are great: they let you get
  what you want out of a meeting, like the Internet they help
  deconstruct the boundaries between presenter and audience. Here's
  what didn't work for me with the format at this podcamp:

- The talks were all in these rooms, and the door was at the front of
  the room. So unless you sat by the door, you had to walk between the
  speaker to get in and out of the room in the middle of the talk.
  Which you're supposed to be able to do. Awkward.

- The opening session was entirely self-congratulatory, and a general
  waste of time. Better, I think to have let presenters in the morning
  sessions talk for a few seconds about their session. There weren't
  that many sessions.

- I'm not *wed* to the idea that people have to determine the
  programing on the spot in the morning of a *camp*, and sometimes
  preparation is a good thing, but if you're going to have multiple
  parallel "tracks" there should be some sort of thematic unity for a
  given track, and some organization around that. *Randomized
  conference schedules don't provide attendees value*.

- In an effort to provide hyper-accessible content for people, there
  were a number of topics that I'd consider to be "hot" like, free
  network services, content curration, microformats and semantic web
  stuff, the real time web, and so on and so forth. Instead there was a
  lot of "get a facebook account and sign up for google analytics."

  So yeah. I hear there's a BarCamp in philly in november. We'll see how
  I'm faring, but it might be cool to talk with people about
  `Sygn <http://www.cyborginstitute.com/wiki/sygn/>`__ at that.
