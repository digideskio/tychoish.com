just here with a thought:

I'm not going to do it in this story because it would muck everything
up, but....

I've seen in a couple of places in the SF world, (dealing with
telepathy) the basic idea where, telekentic abilities are dealt with as
*really strong telepathy*, that if you're a really strong telepath,
maybe you'd be able to move stuff around with your brain.

Right? Ok.

So this sounds all well and good, I mean thoughts are just thoughts, and
moving matter is *hard* because matter is *real*. Right? Ok...

This fundamentally assumes that thought is not material, which I think
is pretty flawed. We think in our brains.

Then, why isn't telepathy, very finely honed telekinesis? Sure it's easy
to lift your tea cup with your brain, but you need much more dexterity
to sense the flow of neurotransmitters and electrical currents in the
brain....

...it seems I need to write some brain SF...

also, and unrelatedly, I don't understand this "superhero" thing that a
lot of people do. it's like alien to me.
