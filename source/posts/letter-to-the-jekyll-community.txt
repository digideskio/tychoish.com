Hey folks,

Having spent a few hours (heh) going through my blog and converting and
modifying it for `jekyll <http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/>`__, I think
it would be appropriate to list some general directions for improvement
of the software. Jekyll is pretty good and it's certainly more than
usable, but I think there is enough room for improvement, and some
additional features that would be rather interesting to explore. Because
I think it's really easy for us to all `develop our own
forks <http://github.com/tychoish/jekyll>`__ and work in relative
isolation, I worry that there's limited space to have a conversation
about how to best improve the platform. Here's a starting point:

-  **Performance** Jekyll, particularly for larger sites can take a
considerable time to run.

I'm not familiar enough with ruby to be able to speak to any areas of
improvement in terms of code optimization, though I'm not sure that this
is the best way to approach this issue. *Rather,* I think it would
probably be best to figure out ways of gracefully preventing jekyll from
recompiling pages that haven't changed every time there's an update. The
possibility that makes the most sense to me at this point would be to
include "masks" in the config file, that jekyll can skip over unless run
with an ``--all`` option.

Another option might be to develop a way to cache/store certain kinds of
output files that require a lot of data to crunch (I'm thinking mostly
of things like archives and of other long post loops.) Maybe developing
some sort of internal index?

-  I'm (preliminarily) looking at using rpeg-markdown as a another
markdown option, which should both allow the extended markdown syntax
to work (woot!) and run much faster than maruku (and hopefully
rdiscount). It seems difficult to install, but would generally be
worthwhile.

-  *Increase usability* While jekyll *just works*, and the documentation
is reasonably effective given the audience; there isn't any automatic
workflow for jekyll use. Having a few shell scripts and/or a "using
jekyll" tutorial that explains day to day use would be quite helpful
once you get started.

As I finalize and put it through it's paces for a few days I'll get more
clear about this, but, in general I'm thinking of things like: using git
hooks to generate the content automatically on commit/etc.

It would be valuable to write up how to use rsync as that would likely
make more sense in some situations. Same with running tasks in cron.

-  **Template Directory**: Most of the jekyll powered blogs that I've
seen have been pretty good about publishing the repositories for
their sites. This is a good thing indeed, but given how the templates
work, I think it would be good to collect various templates together
for ease of access and educational proposes.

-  **Make Categories More Flexible**: While the current blog categories
support is great for adding "multiple blog" support, it makes it
difficult to interact/loop posts that aren't in different categories.
I'd like to have arbitrary ``site.key.value`` objects that work like
``site.categories.CATEGORY``. There are ways to program around this,
but they aren't pretty. This would make jekyll even more incredibly
powerful, but I think it's a much lower priority.

If you use jekyll, I'd love to hear what you'd like to see from the
jekyll in the future. A number of these options (rpeg-markdown,
usability/workflow documentation, template directory) are things that I
can work on (and will, for sure), but a few of them are beyond me and
I'd love to help folks do some of this work, if possible.

Onward and Upward!

(ps. my \_posts directory is about 6.2 megs, with a file count that's a
bit south of 1,300 files, so if you wanted to assert that I'm pushing
the system a *bit* hard, that'd be totally reasonable.)
