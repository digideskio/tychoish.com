Lost Ground and Fresh Starts

Something unfortunate has happened dear readers. The entire databases
for this site as well as CollectiveArts were lost. When all, or most, of
the content of a site is stored in a mySQL database, site management
becomes really easy and the file structure becomes clean and logically
arranged: it's great. When you're old hosts sever craps out and you must
move to a nicer facility with out a database dump: it's a pain in the
ass.

Nothing's changed, and everything works as it should, unfortunately, all
of that old content is here. I should be moping around and fighting like
hell to get a fairly recent backup of the database, but I'm not. Its ok,
and Chris and I will be able to move forward. After all a fresh start
that clears out all of that start that I've started to get a little
embarrassed about is an okay thing. I'm not celebrating it, but it's not
a bad thing. I've posted two of the entries from my personal archive
that I'm rather proud of (and I did postdate one), and we'll continue
from here.

After a month of not having a working website, I'd think that it's good
to be back.
