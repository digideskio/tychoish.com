I got an email today from someone, who, having seen my posting on the
`tealArt knitting blog <http://tychoish.com/knitting/>`__ regarding my
intentions to write patterns, and pictures of some of my designs on
ravelry, encouraged me to write patters because she really liked what
she saw and wanted to knit some of my stranded patterns.

This was amazing. And I feel when people are, basically, asking to give
you money that you should really go with that, because its a sign.

This is something that I've been thinking about for some time, and I did
need the encouragement. But I am at a bit of a loss, about how to
orchestrate it.

The truth is that selling digital wares is a somewhat difficult
proposition: you're selling an idea, not a physicality, and digital
documents are infinitely copyable, so how do you both *not give
everything away for free,* and not turn into an obnoxious capitalist
about the whole scheme.

I think a tip jar-type model is probably the easiest/most likely
solution, but it is difficult to ponder correctly. And I want to have
something that will last long term, and not blow away in a few months
when fads change.

So my first instinct was to write `Cory
Doctorow <http://craphound.com/>`__, about the technological angle of
the document distribution, because this sort of model seems to be right
up his alley. And I think knitting patterns are enough different from
fiction that the models are different enough that it might be
interesting thing to explore.

I'm not sure that I have a good solution, yet, so your input is of
course appreciated, but I'll repost the relevant parts here, below the
fold, *because I can.*

I have a question quandary that I hope you'll be able to offer some
insight on at your connivence.

I do a fair bit of design work for hand knitting, and I've gotten a
few requests to write up and offer some patterns, but I think on a
conceptual level these "things" could be short stories, or essays,
or bits of software programs.

This seems like a generally enviable position, but I'm at a bit of a
loss. I have a number of patterns that are/will be for free/creative
commons downloads. But I have a number big/intense patterns patterns
for sweaters that I'm not sure will work well in this model. So I
guess the crux of my question, is do you know of any good
solution/service that will allow variable pricing/donation models,
for electronic document delivery that don't suck and/or don't make
me seem like an obnoxious capitalist?

Some thoughts about knitting patterns in contrast to other
electronic text solutions:

- The digital copies can sufficiently/completely replace the
physical/paper copies (They're short, so it's feasible to print
them).
- Digital copies are preferable. Many knitters photo copy patterns
from traditionally issued books because it is easier to cary
around a few sheets in a page protector than a whole books.
- If you can get all the patterns that you want from a book,
there's little incentive to buy the book, for many. Many knitters
will only buy a book if X number of patterns seem like things
they would want to knit.

Delightfully, knitters are pretty willing, on the whole to pay for
things (there's disposable income there) and have adapted pretty
well to the internet, so I think that if I can give people a way to
pay for the documents, many will, without needing some sort of tight
fingered system. But I'm largely unaware of what kind of options are
out there.

Any insight is much appreciated.

Cheers, tycho

He suggested the `Lulu.com <http://www.lulu.com/>`__ document delivery
system that lets you both give away things for free and charge for them.
Which seems like a good place to start, though I wrote the following
clarification/response.

I'd sort of like to do something more along the lines of another sky
press http://www.anothersky.org/, so that it presents folks with a
"buy now for \_\_\_\_" box with some reasonable value in it, with an
explanation that you could set it to zero, and you could get it for
free... So that the downloading experience is structured around the
expectation of "not-free" but is still freely available.

I fear having to home bake something, which would take too much time
away from doing other things, like writing, but it might not be
*that* hard.

Thanks, cheers...
