Reasons to Write Fiction in Markdown
====================================

Having basically converted from writing almost exclusively in Word, the
last time I wrote fiction, I'm now enjoying writing in Markdown using
plain text and TextMate. Here's why:

So I've been writing today, and I think, despite a slight false start,
I'm really liking how my writing turned out today. Unlike a lot of other
pursuits (homework, dancing, sometimes knitting) that are really fun
when I'm doing them but draining after the fact, getting writing
done--particularly fiction writing--almost always leaves me feeling
invigorated and fresh. I feel like I can do more when I'm done writing
than I can when I'm done with other things.

What I love about fiction writing in Markdown:

1. It's a subset of HTML, which means that HTML elements work in
markdown. This is cool because as I'm writing I can use HTML comment
tags, <!-- like this -->, to make notes to myself. For instance,
today, I something changed with how I was writing a character today,
so I left a little note to myself marking the occasion, which will
persist with this document, and will be nice to keep with the
documents. Also I'll write up outlines and keep them in comment tags
so that nothing sneaks through. Also TextMate highlights these tags,
so that they look different from the text while you're writing.

2. If you're not writing linearly, or think that you need to go back and
edit a paragraph later, but don't want to break your forward flow
with an edit, you can throw a hash or two or three (#) before the
line and TextMate will mark the entire line in a special color so
that you can pick it out quickly, or jump to it with the quick
reference. If you forget about it, then when you run
`markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`__ or
`maruku <http://maruku.rubyforge.org/>`__, you'll know very quickly
that you have to change something.

3. Mark down makes pushing things out to the web, and a well formated
paper/pdf document equally easy (particularly with Maruku), and I
find tweaking a LaTeX document in TextMate (and even running LaTeX)
to be way better than running it from the command line.

4. The Markdown subversion support is really great, and it's nice to
know that your stuff is all backed up and versioned properly.

5. Between MegaZoom (a SIMBL pluggin) and good text zooming support, a
good--full screen--distraction free writing environment is easy to
obtain, and a pleasure to write in.

6. Slim and Stable. This is a TextMate issue, of course, but, I really
love not having to run Microsoft products.

That's it. Good Wholesome fun.
