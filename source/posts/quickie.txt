no grad school news.

lots of knitting and coding interviews, almost done with sweater.

sleeping well, and upbeat, possibly with reason (speculative), so it
could all come crashing down.

having day out. academic stuff, errands. Tea.

More knitting. the sweater looks really good, but I think without
hem/zipper it's going to look like crap so I'm reminding myself to
withold judgement for a while.

Ok, for real. Sigh.

Think good thoughts, I could hear at any point in the next little bit.
really. I think delusion is the only way people live through these kinds
things.

Onward and Upward!
