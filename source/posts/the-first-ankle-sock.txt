====================
The First Ankle Sock
====================

I recently finished my first knitting project after my
[[return to knitting|/knitting/a-knitting-practice/]]: a pair of ankle
socks in a medium (for socks) weight yarn. The socks are plain and I'm
pleased with the result, but there were some unexpected parts of the
project, and some useful lessons:

These Aren't The Socks You Meant To Make
----------------------------------------

For the most part I'm interested in knitting pretty plain socks in
plain (solid) yarn: probably even undated yarn that I can soak in tea
or henna post-knitting. So the fact that this is one of those
patterned, superwash sock yarn is something of a misnomer.

I also intended to get 7 inch cuffs out of the yarn (in a 50 gram
ball and I even knit most of a sock: but I ran out of yarn. My
assumption that I could knit a 64 stitch sock with sport weight yarn
was a touch over the mark, but it was close.

So having failed that project I took a break from the yarn and ripped
it all back, and attempted to do a 60 stitch sock (right choice!) and
knit a 2 inch cuff.

I could have gotten away with a slightly longer cuff, but I've been
wanting to have a couple of short pairs of socks to wear while
dancing, and to be honest the yarn looked better on the ball than
knitted up.

The first moral: Given enough time, I figured it out.

The second moral: It's ok to rip something out if it doesn't work
out. It's also ok to not rip it out *immediately* after you realize it
doesn't work out.

I Kitchnered Toes All By Myself
-------------------------------

I've never really been successful at kitchnering anything. I find
*every* instruction to be incomprehensible, and every attempt to
kitchner something has ended in disaster. My solution for the past
couple of years has been to send the occasional sock off to my mother
for her to do the honors.

The thing is, I understand the concept of what's happening, which
makes the fact that I couldn't do it so frustrating. While I was
knitting the first sock, I decided that I could probably think my way
through the problem, and after a bit of fussing, I was ale to actually
complete the sock toe.

I had to turn the sock inside out, and the ends weren't perfect, but
it was close.

The Wearing Report
------------------

I wore these socks to a big Balkan Dance festival, and they worked! I
thought the cuffs were a bit too short, but the sizing was correct in
every other regard. Next pair will have slightly longer cuffs.

Huzzah!
