===================================
Wikish and the Personal Public Wiki

First, an announcement. I've started a tychoish.com wiki. I'm calling
it, appropriately enough "`wikish </wikish>`__." You can see a brief
introduction and note about my intentions `there </wikish>`__.

I've written a bunch here about the peculiarities of building
communities and practices around "the wiki," as I think it represents a
new paradigm for thinking about collaboration and "the text." I'm,
slowly, working on building a community around the `cyborg institute
wiki <http://www.cyborginstitute.com>`__, and that's an ongoing (and
fairly specific) project. I've also, in much smaller ways, done things
with wikis in a couple of other situations: for some group projects I've
been involved with, a few things for work, and so forth. Perhaps more
relevantly, I also used a wiki--much like this one and the others I am
responsible for--as the system I used for storing everything in my
brain. From these experiences I've come to the following conclusion:

- In any given wiki, most of the "work," particular at the beginning,
  is accomplished by a very small number of contributors. Potentially
  only one contributor.

  Critical mass is a difficult thing to manage or predict, and if you
  start a wiki and you want it to succeed, you have to be ready to do all
  of the work of getting it to critical mass, which could take a long
  time. Fair warning.

- Wikis are incredibly unstructured. It's easy to impose structure on a
  new wiki, in cases where structure will actually hinder growth and
  development rather than promote development. Particularly if the kind
  of content you hope to develop is wiki like. For personal
  organization tasks, wikis are often *not the right answer*, even if
  they appear to work for a long time.

- Creating a page in a wiki is often better and more effective than
  writing an email of some length (say, more than 250 words),
  particularly when more than two people are involved in the
  correspondence.
  
- I need another wiki like I need a hole in the head. *But*, I like
  that wikish is both public--you all can watch and contribute to what
  I'm working on--and focused on what I'm working on. The personal
  wiki, the one that was just for internal use suffered from lack of
  audience even an imagined audience.

- I think putting the novella that I wrote in late 2007 into a wiki and
  working on revisions and tweaks in that context makes a great deal of
  sense, and I think wikish feels like the "right place" to put that
  work.
  
So that's the plan. I'll probably post from time to time about new
things that I'm posting there, and I'm perfectly happy to have you all
make pages in wikish as you want. I've also decided, that wikish will
require OpenIDs as the only means of authentication. Just cause. See you
there!
