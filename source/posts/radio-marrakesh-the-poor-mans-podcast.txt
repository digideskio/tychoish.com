Radio Marrakesh: The Poor Man&#8217;s Podcast

Because I don't really have time to do a pod-cast, or any kind of
internet radio show (and frankly if I were going to play music I
probably wouldn't find much in a pod-safe directory). So I'm going to
continue blogging as I would otherwise, and offer you a playlist, as a
sort of Intellectual Radio Program. All the thought without any of the
pesky listening.

We'll call it **Radio Marrakesh**, because I think that's what I'm going
to call any radio show or radio-like show that I do. So here's the
playlist. It's a sort of angry political (in my mind) bunch of songs
(with a little humor), that I've been listening to for a while. Powerful
songs, which have a coherent political statement but also have great
emotional power. I don't quite have the order worked out, so don't blame
me there.
