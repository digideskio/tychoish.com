A video of Alcor (identity revealed, news at 10) Talking about
quicksilver, how it's constructed, history, the future, and some stuff
about UI stuff that I think is really cool, mostly because I'm a geek,
but you knew that.

Also, he's cute, but you probably knew I would say that because I'm just
that predictable.

I have to say, that I think quicksilver is probably the marker of the
"real" mac geek. We might not all use it all the time, but most of us
have it and know about it.

I have to admit that I've been using it less of late, though that's
started to change. There are a lot of things that I've found are just
easier to manage in other ways. For instance, I have two "append to
specific files" shell scripts that are aliased in my shell for appending
to my todo lists and my "collection notebook" which I find is a lot
easier than using quicksilver, and I've gotten into a place where I'm
only using a very small number of programs: Adium, MarsEdit, TextMate,
and Mail for most things, with NetNewsWire, Camino, and Preview
reading/displaying content. I don't really use iTunes on a day to day
basis, which was one of those things that quicksilver controls really
well.

Anyway.

Cheers!
