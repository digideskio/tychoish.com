I still don't know anything about graduate school.

I still need to find more regular employment.

I still need to do more work on `tealart <http://tychoish.com/>`__, and
write in a more focused way.

But, I got into ***`Knitting
Camp <http://www.schoolhousepress.com/>`__*** this year. And not only
that, I got into *camp 3*. Which is super cool, because not only is my
`Camp Roomate <http://trickytricot.typepad.net/>`__/Buddy going to be
there (obviously,) knitting mentor R, and
`other <http://the-panopticon.blogspot.com>`__\ s that I'm looking
forward to meeting. There are, by my count going to be 4 men-folk at
this camp (counting myself), which seems pretty cool.

I am, of course, quite excited.

Also, happy leap day. Lets ignore the fact that just yesterday, in a
moment of brain-hiccup, I said, "good thing it's not a leap year,
because it's '06."

*Sigh.*
