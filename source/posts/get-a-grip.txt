I made another Go(lang) thing. `Grip
<https://github.com/tychoish/grip>`_ is a set of logging tools modeled
on Go's standard logging system, with some additional (related)
features, including:

- level-based logging, with the ability to set a minimum threshold to
  exclude log messages based on priority (i.e. debugging.)

- Error capture/logging, to log Go ``error`` objects.

- Error aggregation, in continue-on-error situations, where you want
  to perform a bunch of operations and then return any errors if *any*
  of them returned an error but don't want to return an error after
  the first operation fails.

- Logging to the ``systemd`` journal with fallback to standard library
  logging to standard output.

There are helper functions for logging using different kinds of
default string formatting, as well as functions that take error
objects, and a "lazy" logging method that take a simple interface for
building log messages at log-time rather than at operation time.

None of these features are terribly exciting, and the ``systemd``
library wraps the ``systemd`` library from CoreOS. I'm a big fan of
log levels and priority filtering, so it's nice to have a tool for
that. 

In the future, I'd like to add more generic syslog support if that's
useful, and potentially tools for better categorical logging. There's
also a good deal of repeated code and it might be nice to us this as
an excuse to write a code-generator using ``go tool``.

Pull requests and feedback are, of course, welcome.
