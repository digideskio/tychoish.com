My email management system is a failure.

I have a lot of email addresses. I even have a text file that shows how
all these address' are routed so that I don't end up forwarding messages
from one address to itself after passing it through three steps, which I
have done before.

The hub of my email email system relies on a gmail account that I never
really use, that keeps most of the archive under control, and has an
arcane set of labels and filters. This isn't an address I really use.
All of the important email addresses (the @tealart.com and @tychoish.com
ones; are forwarded into another gmail account, that's really just a
pipe, but it's also the google account that I use the most, and my
primary jabber account.)

Operationally, most of my day to day email, goes through my
RealFirstName@tealart.com account, and I do almost all of this in
Mail.app, apple's email client, and I don't really ever use web-mail,
because I have this amazingly craptastic system of filters and rules
that need to be revised, and I don't have a web-mail account that I can
comfortably live in, although, a few months ago, I might have said that
this was because I always had my laptop with me, and liked the comfort
of offline apps, now I feel like having a bit of extra flexibility would
be a good thing.

This is a pretty big project that would require me to do a number of
things to straighten things out:

-  Deal with archiving my email. ie. taking existing emails and
exporting these emails into a plain text format that I can grep
through when I need to. Store these text files externally.
-  Reorganize system to rely more on search and less on a complex and
deranged file system, more or less modled on gmail's "Stared,"
"Inbox," and "Archived" Model, using smart folders to take care of
day to day operation in Mail.app.
-  Create a revised system of filters, that can sort my mail effectively
with only a few simple filters. Implement these filters in both
Mail.app in the new gmail account.

*Sigh*
