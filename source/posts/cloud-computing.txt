rms, Mr. `GNU Project <http://www.gnu.org/>`__ himself, `recently
interviewed with the
Guardian <http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/sep/29/cloud.computing.richard.stallman>`__
and came out against "cloud computing." While there wasn't a great
"splash" on the blogs I read--no one was surprised, a lot of people
disagreed respectfully, and we all went along our ways--but I think he
raises an important point that we/I should discuss.

rms' argument is that "cloud computing" services, like
`gmail <http://www.gmail.com>`__, `twitter <http://twitter.com/>`__,
`livejournal <http://www.livejournal.com/>`__ lock people into their
services and force computer users to give up control of their computing
and data, and that this is as bad or worse than using proprietary
software.

I too have been a pretty big opponent of some "cloud computing"
developments, not simply because they restrict freedom in the sense that
rms is speaking of, but also because in a lot of cases, it's not a very
good or user friendly environment for a lot of tasks. And I'm pretty
stubborn about not trusting my data to a format that I'm not positive
I'll be able to export into an open and useable format.

As it turns out there are a number of cloud services which are "more
open," than others. That allow users lots of very standard/open access
to their data. It's not the same as open source, of course, but I think
it's important to suggest that all "cloud" services aren't created
equal. Here's a brief review:

1. GMail provides full pop and IMAP access to their accounts. They also
make it easy for you to use your gmail account to send "from" other
accounts. While you get more freedom from hosting your email on a
server you control, gmail isn't less free (in my estimation) than
using the email address supplied by your ISP or employer.
2. Gcal similarly exports to ical format, which is the default calendar
standard format, among others.
3. Most "cloud" news readers export OMPL files of all the feeds,
similarly the "make RSS feeds of everything," mentality of web 2.0
means that a lot of data is pretty open to access.

There are of course some web-apps where data is opaque and not
easily/openly exportable. Twitter is a great example of this, and I'm
blanking on a more extensive list, but I'm sure that you, dear readers,
can come up with many more examples.

I think what this means in the end is that the problem of freedom in
software in the age of service-based computing rests more on user
education than on a legalistic mechanisms (like copyleft) or open source
code. Not that the later isn't important, but I think it's worth
considering.
