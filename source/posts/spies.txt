So I'm writing a book where many of the characters are basically CIA
agents. Which has meant that I have needed to spend some time thinking
more seriously about intelligence and counterintelligence operations.

Then, an event in my *real life* inspired the following
realization/observation:

If you're gathering intelligence and you discover something you don't
like, because you're spying, you can't really be upset when you unearth
this information.

Scouts honor, or something.
