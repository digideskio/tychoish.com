Where Innovation Happens, Part Two

In my `post against the venture capital
model <http://tychoish.com/posts/venture-capital-and-software/>`__ I
think one key question that I think I failed to answer is "If we do away
with venture capital, where does innovation happen?" This post locates a
number of potentials answers to this question.

1. Innovation happens in academia and research-oriented institutions.
This is where innovation has often happened, and it makes sense: you
get smart driven people together and you give them resources and you
say learn about the world, and see what new things you can make and
think that haven't been made and thought of before. The problem is
that research is hard to fund and support, and the Academy is often
drawn toward the other great role it fulfills in our society
(education).

2. Innovation happens in external communities. Red Hat, and Sun both
externalize innovation via the Fedora Project and Open Solaris
projects. Many web-development consultancies externalize their
innovation to Open Source projects like Ruby on Rails, and Drupal.
It's a pooling of research and development via externalization, and I
think it's a trend that we'll probably begin to see more of.

3. Innovation will happen during 20% time. Google was famous for doing
this, initially and I think it's something that we don't hear much of
as corporate purses begin to tighten as maximum productivity
reappears as the leading way to save corporate business models (See,
flawed system,) but I think the concept that some measure of
unstructured time will lead to innovation is generally a sound
concept.

4. Innovation, start-ups, the same way that they are formulated now,
except without venture capital, so that innovation still happens in
start-ups, but business plans will have to be focused on sustainable
growth, scaling practices, and profitability. This shifts the focus
of start-ups to think about "how do we implement this cool idea in a
way that will work," rather than "what would happen if we did this
cool thing." Seems a productive nearly-paradigm shift.

Other ideas?
