Org Mode Guilt and a Lisp Function
----------------------------------

I have some guilt about having mostly forsaken org-mode, [1]_ in
particular because I was watching `Sacha Chua's chat with John
Wiegley <http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/06/emacs-chatting-with-john-wiegley-about-the-cool-things-he-does-with-emacs/>`__,
and I think both are such nifty hackers, and have done so many things
that are pretty darn nifty.

I liked what I heard about ``johnw``'s org mode setup so much that I
might give it a try again. But in the mean time, I wanted to make my
"recompile my tasklist function" to be a bit more clean. The result is
follows:

::

(defun tychoish-todo-compile ()
(interactive)
(if (get-buffer "*todo-compile*")
(progn
(switch-to-buffer-other-window (get-buffer "*todo-compile*"))
(recompile))
(progn
(compile "make -j -k -C ~/wiki")
(switch-to-buffer-other-window "*compilation*")
(rename-buffer "*todo-compile*")))
(revbufs))

Notables:

-  This is the first time I've used ``progn`` which is somewhat
embarrassing, but it's a great thing to have in the toolkit now.
Link:
`progn <http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-aintro/html_node/progn.html>`__

-  I hadn't realized until now that there wasn't an ``else-if`` form in
emacs lisp. Weird, but it makes sense.

-  `Compilation
Mode <http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Compilation-Mode.html>`__
is pretty much my current favorite thing in emacs.

-  `revbufs <http://www.neilvandyke.org/revbufs/>`__ is this amazing
thing that reverts buffers if there aren't local modifications, and
also reports to you if a buffer has changed outside of emacs and
there are local modifications. So basically "does everything you want
without destroying anything and then tells you what you need to do
manually." Smart. Simple. Perfect.

I might need to "macro-ize" this, as I have a lot of little compile
processes for which I'd like to be able to trigger/maintain unique
compile buffers. That's a project for another day.

Emacs Thoughts
--------------

I'm even thinking about putting together a post about how, although I'm
a diehard emacs user, and I've spent a fair bit of time learning how to
do really great things with emacs, there are a lot of vim-ish things in
my workflow:

-  I read email with `mutt <http://mutt.org>`__ and I've tried to get
into GNUS, and I try it again every now and then, but I always find
it so unbelievably gnarly. At least the transition. Same with
`Notmuch <http://notmuch.org>`__, which I like a lot more (in
theory,) but I find the fact that Notmuch and ``mutt`` have this
fundamental misunderstanding about what constitutes a "read" email,
to be tragic.

-  I use a crazy `ikiwiki <http://ikiwiki.info/>`__ +
`deft <http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/>`__ + makefile setup for
task tracking. As (obliquely) referenced above.

I might give org another shot, and I've been looking at `task
warrior <http://taskwarrior.org/projects/show/taskwarrior>`__, but the
sad truth is that what I have *works incredibly well* for in most cases,
and switching is hard.

-  I tend jump to a shell window to do version control and other things,
even though I'm familiar with
`magit <http://philjackson.github.com/magit/>`__ and ``dired``, my
use of these tools is somewhat spotty.

It's not that I think org-mode sucks, or anything. Far from it, but
how I was using org-mode was fundamentally *not* working for me. I'm
thinking about giving it a try again, but we'll see.
