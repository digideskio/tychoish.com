I totally started to write a today in review post for yesterday, except
I never got around to writing it. When I got back to my computer this
morning, I saw an open window with the words "today in review" in the
title field.

But the window was blank.

Yesterday was one of those incredibly full days that never quite seems
to stop, and I went to bed at like 9:30 or 10. Today promises to be
better...

I might actually have things to blog. Also, I need to be better about
reading my feeds, or the new and lowered number won't help much, but
there is writing that needs/wants to be done.
