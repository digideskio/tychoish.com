I must admit that I don't consume knitting books in the normal manner.
Patterns rarely interest me, and many of the knitting books which have
been popular of late, are very interested in sharing the craft with a
new generation, teaching the basic skills of knitting, purling, casting
on and binding off, with a hip(ster) flare. And while I appreciate the
presence of some of these books (Most notably, Sally Melville's "The
Knitting Experience," books, *The Knit Stitch*, *The Purl Stitch*, and
now *Color*, but most of the other dribble out there, is just that.
Sorry to offend, I have minor beef with the Stitch and Bitch/Bust
franchise, and many of the other books around to me seem to be
repetitive, and not suited to my purposes. To each their own.)

Having said that, there are a number of knitting books that I **do**
enjoy a lot, and I thought I'd list them out here. It'll show you where
I'm coming from, and then again it might just show you something good to
look for, if you're in need of good knitting reading.

No particular order.

Alice Starmore. *Fisherman's Sweaters*.

Anne L. MacDonald. *No Idle Hands: The Social History of American
Knitting*

Ann Feitelson. *The Art of Fair Isle Knitting: History, Technique,
Color, & Patterns*.

Meg Swansen. *Meg Swansen's Knitting*.

Elizabeth Zimmerman. *Knitting Without Tears*.

Alice Starmore. *The Fair Isle Knitting Handbook*. (also *Alice
Starmore's Book of Fair Isle Knitting*.)

Enjoy!
