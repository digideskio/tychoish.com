I read `this post <http://blog.liw.fi/posts/living-off-freedom/>`__ by
one of the partners in one of the coolest `web
services <http://branchable.com>`__ around, you should open that in a
new window and then come back.

Back? Great!

Lars, proposes crowd-funding as a way to support free software
development. Basically, run a "sponsor me to develop stuff" program, but
rather than fund free software as a start-up around a single project or
work for a big vendor.

It's a nifty idea, and it's got me thinking about
micro-entrepreneurship. This would be where you *make* or *do* things,
but not on a big scale. The businesses you create are small, and
probably aren't completely full-time equivalent, but in aggregate *it's
good enough*. While this is not the most prominent form of
entrepreneurship on the internet, my sense is that it's way bigger than
most people think.

We're too used to seeing multi-million dollar venture capital fund
raising, IPOs, big acquisition deals, to realize the multitude of people
who are making a few to several tens of thousands of dollars doing much
smaller amounts of work.

I suppose I could write a whole post on 
:doc:`good enough economics </posts/good-enough-economics>` in the vein of `this post on
patronage from
JamesGovernor <http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/2007/01/04/on-jon-udell-freedom-talent-management-and-the-new-patronage-economy/>`__
but I'll just leave a place holder link to a wiki page, in case someone
else wants to fill things in.

Thoughts:

- Service-businesses don't scale particularly well, any individual work
  can only produce so much work, and it's hard to make individuals any
  more productive. In light of that, large service-based firms are
  unlikely to form.

- Most people have pretty specialized skills and abilities.
  Self-employment, particularly full time employment makes it difficult
  for people to spend most of their time doing what their best at.
  Specialization and differing skills is also what creates a market for
  service-based endeavors.

- Lacking health care and other benefits of traditional employment,
  it's hard for people to be more self-employed and less
  conventionally-employed. Given this, doing entrepreneurial projects
  on a smaller scale makes more sense.

- Some kinds of entrepreneurial activities are attractive because,
  while they may not produce the same level of income as a salaried
  position, they allow more freedom and flexibility. This is the
  conventional justification for self-employment, and also the reason
  that most aligns with the "good enough" policy.

The problem with these kinds of "little businesses," is that it's too
easy to focus on income earning work (e.g. freelance, and client work,)
at the expense of doing basic work (e.g. developing core free software,
doing basic research, writing fiction.) While the crowd sourcing notion
makes a lot of sense, it requires a lot of faith in the crowd. I'm also
unsure of how sustainable it is: while individuals can justify small
amounts of money for such purposes, organizations cannot. Without
organizational support, revenue is much lower, and it probably puts the
larger financial burden on the smaller users, relatively speaking.
