Here's some third-degree linking. At *tychoish* we're nothing if not on
top of our citationality.

`Jesus
who? <http://jeffreyricker.wordpress.com/2007/06/22/jesus-who/#comments>`__:

`Schulman <http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6454533.html>`__,
who’s currently working on an oral history of ACT-UP, remembered
that she’d never heard the name Jesus Christ until one day in her
schoolyard. ‘I ran home and asked my grandmother ‘Who is Jesus
Christ?’ and my grandmother said, ‘Well, there was this girl named
Mary who got in trouble and made up this story.’’

Priceless. (Link courtesy of
