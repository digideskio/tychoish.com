Updates: Tech Writing and Wiki Gardening

Yesterday, I posted over at `Critical
Futures <http://criticalfutures.com/>`__ the second of, an apparent,
series of four posts on `dexy <http://dexy.it>`__.
:doc:`:Dexy </technical-writing/dexy>` is cool because it's a pretty nifty
tool for doing documentation in a new and potentially very powerful
manner. While I think playing around with Dexy is cool and important
(and I'm having fun tinkering a little, seeing the world in a slightly
different way and then running away to absorb and re-assess) it's also
very important to think about the reasons why tools like Dexy are
incredibly important.

Read on for: **`Dexy and Literate
Documentation <http://criticalfutures.com/2011/01/dexy-and-literate-documentation>`__**

Also, as part of this post and
`series <http://criticalfutures.com/archive/technical-writing>`__
(archive recently updated!) I've been developing a [[technical
writing\|technical-writing]] section of this wiki, which has included a
couple of little pages and snippets that I've been hanging onto for a
while, and a number of pages that I think I'd like to write wiki pages
on. These include three major issues in technical writing and the tools
used to build documentation resources that build tools that yesterday's
addresses. They are: [[technical-writing/atomicity]] or smaller "atomic"
units of documentation, [[technical-writing/compilation]] or generating
documentation statically before publication rather than dynamically on
view, and [[flitering\|technical-writing/filters]] as an approach to
document generation.

--------------

I'd like to perceptively apologize if my blogging here is not
particularly interesting, or topical except in a very "meta" sort of
way. One of my primary goals for tychoish.com-as-a-wiki is to be able to
keep track of and document the work that I'm doing on line that isn't
necessarily blog-post related. Blogging is great, but it's hard to
balance writing blog posts and providing a good media outlet *and* the
kind of work required for developing wiki pages and moving forward on
other sorts of projects. These posts, in addition to spreading links,
and offering short partially formed thoughts, will likely serve to draw
attention to various things I'm working on.

The idea of `wiki gardening <http://c2.com/wiki/>`__ isn't new, but I
like it. Wiki's are so simple and so easy to create that the only thing
you can really do to cause a wiki to fail is to neglect it. Not that the
proper care and feeding of a wiki isn't challenging, but it is *simple*.
In any case I suspect many of the [[tag/meta]] posts will be "gardening"
posts in the sense that they'll draw attention to recent edits of wiki
pages and note the new and developing pages in solicitation of your
contribution.

Shovels up!
