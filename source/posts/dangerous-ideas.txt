Ok, this was fascinating. From my stash of cool academic blogs..

`The end of
insight? <http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/01/the_end_of_insi.html>`__

"In my own field of complex systems theory, Stephen Wolfram has
emphasized that there are simple computer programs, known as
cellular automata, whose dynamics can be so inscrutable that there's
no way to predict how they'll behave; the best you can do is
simulate them on the computer, sit back, and watch how they unfold.
Observation replaces insight. Mathematics becomes a spectator
sport."

Revolution <http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/>`__.)
