A few months ago I got a `Happy Hacking
Keyboard <http://pfuca-store.stores.yahoo.net/haphackeylit1.html>`__
because, hey, I'm a writer and a GNU/Linux guy, and I use almost
entirely keyboard driven software/desktop environment `a good keyboard
seems like a reasonable
investment. <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/input-fetishes-and-tool-quality/>`__.

So after a few months, what do I think? The keyboard is great. I don't
miss the keys, I like having everything in reach, I like being able to
have my tea close and not have to move as far for the mouse when I need
it. Additionally, and you wouldn't believe how true this is, but the
keys feel **so nice** to type on. It's nosier, the response is good (not
buckling springs good, but quite nice), and I defiantly feel the
difference between it and other computers (let alone laptops; I tried to
type on a MacBook the other day, and it was quite nearly painful.) If
anyone is looking for a new keyboard, this is defiantly one to consider,
and if size is an issue, then I (probably) wouldn't consider anything
else.

Keep on typing!
