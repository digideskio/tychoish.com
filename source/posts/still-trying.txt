I futzed around with `this
idea <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/someone-make-this-work/>`__ for a bit
using php bloxsom, and well, I got it to handle markdown the way I want
it to, and the page header stuff. but other than that. not so much.
sigh. well what's time anyway.

I think the problem with this is that bloxsom is too blog-oriented, and
for that, wordpress does a slightly better job, or at least, I'm more
comfortable with it, even if I don't need very many of the features.

Though I have to say, for the notebook idea, which is what tychoish is
supposed to be, I think bloxosm is better, I just don't feel like
fucking around with it.

anyone with better ideas?
