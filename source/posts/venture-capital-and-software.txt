I read `this article by Joel Spoolsky about the first dot-com
bust <http://www.inc.com/magazine/20090701/joel-spolsky-the-day-my-industry-died.html?partner=fogcreek>`__
and it help crystallized a series of thoughts about the role of venture
capital in the development of technology and software, particularly of
Internet technologies. Give it a shot. Also, I think `Cory Doctorow's
"Other People's
Money," <http://www.forbes.com/2007/10/13/cory-doctorow-fiction-tech-future07-cx_cd_1015money.html>`__
is a helpful contributor to this train of thought.

The question I find myself asking myself is: to what extent is the
current development of technology--particularly networked
technology--shaped by the demands of the venture capital market? And of
course, what kind of alternative business models exist for new
technologies?

I guess I should back up and list the problems *I* have with the VC
model. And by VC model I mean private investment firms that invest large
sums of money in "start up" companies. Those issues are:

-  Breaking even, even in--say--five years, is exceptionally difficult
from a numbers perspective, let alone turning a profit of any note.
This is largely because VC funding provides huge sums of money (it is
after all really hard to give away 20 billion a year in 60-120k a
year tops.) and so seed sums are larger than they need to be, and
this has a cascade effect on the way the business and technology
develops, particularly in unsustainable ways.

-  VC-funded start-ups favor proprietary software/technologies, because
the payoff is bigger up front, which is often the case. It's hard to
make the argument that you need seed money for a larger, more slow
moving product... Small and quick seem to work better.

-  The VC-cycle of boom and bust (which is sort of part and parcel with
plain-old-capitalism) means that technology development booms and
busts: so that a lot of projects tank when the market crashes, and
that the projects that get funded during the booms are (probably
mostly) not selected for their technological merit.

-  VC firms tend to be very responsive to fads and similar trends in the
market. (e.g. dot-com bubble, web 2.0, Linux in the mid nineties,
biotech stuff, etc.) which means that VC firms generate a great deal
of artificial competition in these markets, which disperses efforts
needlessly, without (as near as I can tell) improving the quality of
software developed (eg. in the microblogging space, for example, the
"first one out of the gate," twitter, "won" without apparent regard
for quality or feature set.)

Venture capital funding provides outfits and enterprising individuals
with the resources for "capital outlay" and initial
research-and-development costs, and in doing so fills an economic niche
that is otherwise non-existent, and this is a good thing indeed. At the
same time I can't help but wonder if the goals an interests of venture
capitalists aren't--in some ways--directly at odds with the technology
that they aim to develop.

I also continue to question the ongoing role of this kind of "funding
structure" (for lack of a better term). I think it's pretty clear that
the effect of continuing technological development is the fact that the
required "capital outlay" of any given start up is falling like a rock
as advanced technology is available at commodity-prices (eg. VPSs,
Lulu.com), as open source software tightens development cycles (eg. Ruby
on Rails, JQuery). Both of these trends, in combination with the
long-standing problems with VC funding, means that I think it's high
time we ask some fairly serious questions about the development of this
technology. I'll end with the question at the forefront of my thinking
on the subject:

Where does (and can) innovation and development happen outside of the
context of venture-capital funded start ups in the technology world?
