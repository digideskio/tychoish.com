this is a draft of course of something that's been floating around in my
head...

Julia: here to set up your data portal.

David: don't tell me you're the tech.

Julia (agast): I'm not the tech, I'm the systems, data and node
administrator, do you still want the data portal or not?

David: oh, right that's not what I meant at all. sorry, no, I mean
yes I want the portal, I was just sort of surprised at how young you
all are these days.

Julia: oh! sorry. I'm still a little buzzed.

david: a bit early even for someone so young.

Julia: not that kind of buzz. it's the nets. I was working all
night. and I'm not that young.

david; oh. right. sorry....
