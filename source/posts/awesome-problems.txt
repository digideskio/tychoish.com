This is a continuation of my earlier post on `the awesome window
manager <>`__ read there for the background. I'm going to focus on some
of the challenges that I've had trying to use the `awesome window
manager <http://awesome.naquadah.org>`__

Applications made for Awesome
-----------------------------

The truth is that most (linux) applications work pretty well with
awesome, so linux users won't need to find new programs. GNOME and KDE
apps all work fine. Having said that there are some applications which
are more suited to the "Awesome" environment. Generally anything that
runs in the terminal is fair game. That means `mutt for
email <http://www.mutt.org/>`__, `vimperator for
firefox <http://vimperator.mozdev.org/>`__, `mcabber for
jabber <http://www.lilotux.net/~mikael/mcabber/>`__ (but there are `some
issues here <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/the-mutt-of-im/>`__).
`Terminator <http://www.ubuntugeek.com/terminator-multiple-gnome-terminals-in-one-window.html>`__
is my favorite terminal/console program.
`Irssi <http://www.irssi.org/>`__ for IRC. `Vim <http://www.vim.org/>`__
as a texteditor.

That's a good place to start as any, but I'm sure that there are other
apps out there that I'm missing. Your thoughts and suggestions of cool
command line apps is always appreciated. Non-Awesome apps that I find
myself using with awesome include
`Cream <http://cream.sourceforge.net/>`__, and
`Pidgin <http://www.pidgin.im/>`__.

The Scripting is Hard.
----------------------

This is mostly a whine, and something that I can get over. Ideally once
I get this to work, I can save this Lua file and make awesome work
wherever I need to in no time flat, but it's a lot to get the brain
around. I think it might help if there were more examples of `Awesome
configuration
files <http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page>`__ to
ease the tradition. Furthermore, I think it might also be helpful if
there was a structure for multiple config files, or an allowance for
"sourced" files (a la mutt/vim/bash). Basically I think it'd be cool to
have a "widgets" file and a "tag file" and a key-binding file. Or at
least have the option of such. This would make tweaking the config file
much easier, and give some structure to a chaotic system.

Notifications
-------------

I'm a big fan of growl, the notification framework for OS X. which makes
it easy to get notifications if you have a lot of windows open, have
things running in the background, or need to track things running in the
background. I haven't found an equivalent solution, though I'm sure
something exists.

Things I haven't figured out yet:
---------------------------------

- I want to be able to assign firefox to only open in (multiple)
  selected tags, but not in others, and I'm not sure how to make this
  work.

- Some sort of menu of currently running applications that would let
  users select a running application/client and jump to the appropriate
  tag. That would be *awesome.*

- Using
  `this <http://git.glacicle.com/other/configs.git/.config/awesome/rc_30.lua>`__
  configuration file, I can't get the pidgin (or any other) system tray
  icons to pop up. Weird.

--------------

The truth is that Awesome pretty much does what you want it to do, and
there aren't any real serious bugs or oversights. Part of this is
Awesome's success at having a very clear and limited scope, and part of
this is the fact that just about everything that Awesome doesn't do, you
can use the existing tools from GNOME or KDE (the more typical open
source desktop environments.) But I think it's useful to at least make
note of the frustrations, if nothing else so that people newer to
awesome than I don't feel so lost. It's normal, and I think (hope?)
it'll get better.
