`Chris <http://www.cgkreality.com/>`__ and I had a discussion about
`LiveJournal <http://www.livejournal.com/>`__ last night, that lead in
some interesting directions.

Though the discussion was started by the impending (21st March 2008) day
long boycott of the site (which I'm not commenting on, and neither know
enough about to pass judgment, nor am particularly moved by the whole
deal), but quickly moved on to a contemplation of LJ, and you know, the
internet as a whole.

*I wrote this entry yesterday but didn't post it. It's since come to
my attention that the rhetoric of the strike errs towards
anti-semitism, which is a bit troubling. I think I've technically
read my friends page since midnight GMT yesterday, and this post
will get pushed to LJ, so I guess that I'm not participating.*

*I'd also say that it doesn't strike me that anything is
particularly different this time around. When I joined LJ the first
time (with my old handle as the username), you had to be
invited/have a code from an existing user, there weren't free
accounts. Frankly I think that's part of the reason that the LJ
community is what it is. As for the censorship stuff, that's not
particularly new and though distasteful, a completely enforceable
part of the terms of service. Anyway, on with the entry...*

What we recognized was that LJ is basically the *only consistently
successful social networking site* on the internet, ever. Furthermore
later social networking sites, like facebook and myspace, have started
to look more and more like LJ as time goes on. The facebook "feed" is a
lot like the LJ friend's page, the facebook profile and the LJ userinfo
page are remarkably similar. And so forth.

The surprising thing is that LJ, though developed and changed over the
years, is pretty much the same thing that it's always been, and that's
sort of cool.

I attribute the success of LJ to two things: the friends page, and the
granularity of security that "friend's locking" provides. The diverse
and dedicated (and not unsizeable) userbase seals the deal.

While I adore `Wordpress <http://wordpress.org/>`__, and think that it's
great software, the truth is that
`WordPress.com <http://wordpress.com/>`__ and
`blogger <http://www.blogger.com/>`__ that preceded it, really can't
hold a candle to LJ because though there are "community features"
(comments, blogrolls, rss feeds) the "blog," they don't have the
friend's page. [1]_

And admittedly, today, we have things like Google Reader and other RSS
services, and Open ID that go a long way to replicate the "f-list"
experience, but it isn't the same, and it isn't automatic. Often, in
this whole cyberspace adventure, I think independence is the way to go,
but I really think that in the case of LJ, there's no way to do the
community aspect of blogging or social networking as successful in an
independent sort of way [2]_.

Our conversation ended with Chris' recolection that he thought--years
ago--that we should have tried to replicate the LJ phenomena and improve
upon it somehow. He/we was/were always unclear of the details. The
conversation then moved on to a discussion of programing languages and
methods and projects, both historical and future. I will no doubt
continue to blog/write about where this train of thought is taking us,
but I think the observations about LJ and what constitutes success in
terms of software and cyber/social phenomena will prove useful in the
future.

Onward and Upward!

I think/fear that "blogs" are seen as too much as sole
proprietorships, in a way. Blog publishing is mostly akin to magazine
publishing or newspaper publishing, and I think that LJ is a much
closer approximation of say
`Usenet <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet>`__, or the BBS, than
any traditional publishing venture. Simply put, *bloggers have an
audience, online journalers have a community.*

We'll note that there's no real independent/autonomous social
networking, the beauty of these sites is that they throw all of the
data into a single database and run with it. You can't do that on an
island.
