So about this social networking thing....

Actually I have no idea of how to lead into this conversation. I've had
accounts with all the the social networking sites, if not from each of
their very beginnings, then from pretty early on in their respective
developments. Each site--friendster, orkut, myspace, facebook, virb--has
a different crowd, and in it's own way that's kind of interesting, and
I've never felt that using one site necessarily precludes using another
one. But over the last little while, I've been thinking about *this
whole social network thing*, particularly in light of
`ravlery <http://www.ravelry.com>`__ Here are some thoughts:

- People join and use the social networking sites that their friends
use. College students use facebook. Hipsters, musicians, and high
school students (at least in the US) are more likely to use myspace,
for example. This is why features don't matter, it's all about the
crowd, and the truth is that most of these sites look and behave more
or less like the others, and the features converge.
- I think there are a couple kinds of social networking sites: the ones
that center around a profile (facebook, myspace friendster) and those
that center around an activity (twitter, ravlry, livejournal, vox,
viddlr[sic?], etc.) The latter ends up being much more successfull in
the long term, because these sites and communities work their way
into peoples lives. It's sort of interesting that people and
companies have managed to capitalize on the social aspect of the
Internet that always used to exist on Usenet and IRC, and also create
a niche for the profile-based sites. Though interestingly, I think
these profile based sites sort of fill the role that the "personal
homepage," used to fill. That is before people realized that personal
home-pages were kind of lame.
- Social networking sites that are about collecting friends are doomed
to fail, because collecting friends is boring, and because at some
point, everyone realizes that their threshold for "adding" new people
to their "friends" is so low that it turns out it's kind of creepy
and then we walk away and try and forget it.
- The less control a company/website gives over someone, the better
people will feel about that site. Truth I think if you could access
livejournal over gopher or a command-line/terminal it would be pretty
awesome. But seriously think about it. Many people have started
saying that facebook has jumped the shark when they gave users
control over how their profiles looked.

So that's what's on my mind. It's interesting I'm pretty religious about
checking ravelry (and LJ) these days, and while I still keep an eye on
facebook, I'm not as into it as I used to be. I think it's interesting
to see how these things develop mostly because I've pretty much given up
trying to figure out what's going to happen next.

Onward and Upward!
