Org Mode and Mobile Writing
===========================

This post is adapted from a post I made to the org-mode
`email list <http://orgmode.org/worg/org-mailing-list.html>`_ a few weeks ago. I
proposed an application to compliment
`MobileOrg <http://mobileorg.ncogni.to/>`__ for writing. Where MobileOrg
collects the core bits of org-mode's task planning functionality in a
form that makes sense for smart phone users, the parts of org-mode
functionality that people use to for writing and organizing the content
of larger form projects isn't particularly accessible.

I spend (or should spend) 70% or more of my time in front of a computer
writing or editing something in org-mode. Most of my org files have tens
of thousands of words of blog posts, notes, drafts of articles, *and so
forth.* While I can store that data on an android device with only minor
problems using a little script that I put
together, and I can capture content into my
org-files using email and some nifty filters, and there
*are* text editors that can let me edit these files: *it could be
better*.

The proposal is simple. Can we build something like Epistle for
org-mode? It might just render org-mode text to HTML, and frankly that
would be enough for me. If the editing interface had an
`org-indent-mode <http://orgmode.org/manual/Clean-view.html>`__
equivalent, org-syntax highlighting, and even collapsing trees or
`org-narrow-to-subtree <http://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-editing.html>`__,
that'd be kind of like heaven.

I'm not a mobile developer, so I can't promise to start making an app
this instant if there's interest but if anyone's bored and thinks this
might be a good idea (or knows of something that might work better for
this.) I'd love to hear about it. If someone wants to start work on
this, I'll do whatever I can to help make this a reality.

Onward and Upward!
