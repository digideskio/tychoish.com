I wish there was a good way, in the context of a blog post or some other
convenient digital media, to regularly say: "I've done some things, you
may be interested in them," and "I'd like to do some things, here are
some notes of what I think I'd like to be working on in the next little
bit." I've yet to find a good way to get in the habit of writing this
kind of post.

My instinct is to have something that I can template and automate pretty
strongly so that I can mostly focus on *doing things* rather than
writing blog posts about doing things. Or as is presently the case, blog
posts blog posts about doing things. Oy. [[Ideas and
suggestions\|discourse]] on this topic would be most appreciated.

So what have I been up to? Well...

- I got back into writing fiction this week after several weeks away. I
  was in a difficult part of the story and life got very... full... and
  I stopped writing regularly. These things happen, but it's good to be
  back at least some.

  After the work I did just last night, I realize that I'm much closer to
  the end of this novel than I had thought. Even if things go very slowly
  for the next few months, I think I'll be able to get this thing done by
  the end of May. I just have to write about a thousand words to finish
  Chapter 11, and there are three to four little vignettes in chat per 12
  to wrap the whole thing up. And it's going to be *awesome*.

  I'm super excited to be done with this project and to be able to spend
  some time cleaning it up and making it an awesome text, but also being
  able to work on making other things I've written better, and to *be able
  to write new things*, with my undivided attention.

- I've updated the [[essay/anti-rodentia]] and the associated
  [[essay/anti-rodentia/discourse]] page with some changes that I think
  make the system work much better.

- I've upgraded to Firefox 4, which I really like a lot: it's much
  faster, it's much more minimal (visually) which is great. Also all of
  my plugins and extensions work without issue. Good job!

- I went through a blast from my past when I pulled together the
  [[queer-theories]] page, which does some--at this point utterly
  redundant--definitional work about what it means to be queer, and
  potential limitations on queer identity/politics in the era of a
  broadly defined queer.

- I've started adding recurring tasks to keep me on track with writing
  and posting entries to this post. This means I don't end up posting
  things *months* after I write them. As was the case with [[Mutt Sucks
  Less\|essay/mutt-sucks-less]], a post I wrote many months ago and
  posted with some revisions last week.

- I made a [[folk]] page for frequent comm enter and discourse
  participant :doc:`:matt </madalu>` that includes a snippet which makes a
  list (and RSS feed!) of all pages that link to "madalu" or are tagged
  with "madalu" (his handle). You can see this by editing the page, and
  use it when making your own [[folk]] pages. Which you should
  *totally* do.

Have a good weekend!
