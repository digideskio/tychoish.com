===================
un-creative writing
===================

I have never, really, taken a creative writing class.

When I talk to people about writing, I think people always assume that I
studied creative writing, or that the whole graduate school thing was
about writing programs or some such.

And while I respect and `a
number <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_R._Delany>`__ `of
people <http://wildflowerfeever.livejournal.com>`__ who are involved in
the discipline of "creative writing," I am not terribly enticed either
by the possibilities of the field as a dialogue, or by the utility of
the training for myself.

This might be a personal short coming, as I have always (since I was a
teenager) been pretty resistant to "formal writing education," and it
might be a genre thing (science fiction doesn't fare terribly well in CW
programs on the whole, often relegated to "children's and popular
literature" tracks, if not totally spurned.) In any case this was
highlighted by `an article I read last
week <http://chronicle.com/jobs/news/2008/07/2008071501c.htm>`__ that
suggested, what I thought was an utterly flawed writing methodology.

The basic idea was that as a general practice, you rewrite everything,
on the theory that you basically can never get something right the first
time, no matter how much time and effort you spend on it, and that the
second time you sit down with a piece that you've written, only then can
you really get it *right.*

Now, the technicality is that she's probably right on some level. Ground
up rewrite's shouldn't be feared, and there are a lot of times when this
can fix something that's "stuck." For example, I'm told that Tolkein sat
down and wrote the *Lord of the Rings,* (the whole thing, not just
specific books) until he got stuck. And then he started over from the
beginning. The entire trilogy, every time he got stuck, until finally
Frodo *et al* got to sail into the sunset. That might be extreme.

The problem is, I think, that we are incredibly inaccurate judges of our
own work. This is why we have editors and readers, and that interaction
is so valuable. So yeah, if someone says "this doesn't work," sure,
rewrite rather than try and salvage, if that's your speed. But as a
rule? I'm suspicious of such unequivocal methodological imperatives.

I've heard `Cory Doctorow <http://craphound.com/>`__ say something to
the effect of, "some days you write and it feels divinely inspired and
the words just flow out, and other days it's like pulling elephant
teeth, but two weeks later, when you're reading over the back you can't
tell the difference." This is, I think why editors of all sorts are so
valuable. And, since on the day-to-day level it's probably crap shoot
anyway, the key is to try and try often. If you think that first drafts
are always to be thrown out, even after editing them as the article
suggests you may do, then--time being finite--you write less, but I
doubt that you write twice as well. And I am unabashedly of the mind
that practicing productivity and developing good habits and experiences
is more important than developing perfectionism. Your milage might vary.

And then it struck me--after the outrage passed--that this came from a
*writer.* Someone who is professionally obligated to be invested more in
the precession of words on the page than of the ideas that they
represent. [1]_ Which is, the core, I guess, of my *personal* unease
with creative writing: I'm way more interested in studying the ideas,
the people, the history of what I write about than the words on the
page, again this arcs back to `what ira
said <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/ira-glass-on-creativity/>`__ the way
to get good at something is to do it, and do it often, and not always
"getting it right." And maybe if an academic program is the way to
motivate you to write a lot, then that's great [2]_ but `having a
blog <http://criticalfutures.com>`__ might achieve a similar goal.

I'm exactly not making a case for sloppy prose--except maybe I am. My
preference is strong characters, plot, and/or conceptual work over
pretty, or even sharp language. Always. And I think people who are in
the process of figuring out how they write and write best, are much
more likely in need of figuring out how to do the conceptual work,
not the mechanics, which comes with practice, and is, I'm convinced a
numbers game, "the million words of crap," and all that. If nothing
else mandatory rewriting, confuses the conceptual development that I
think grows from working with a lot of different ideas/stories; and
the technical development that grows from attention, editing
(rewriting), and time.

.. [2]
it's also a route to a job that you wouldn't necessarily be able to
get otherwise, but that's another story that I'm not interested in
telling.
