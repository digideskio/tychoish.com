Act One: Personality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**tycho** *describes to professor one of the reasons why he didn't get
into graduate school last year*: ... and I applied to personality
programs as well ...

**professor**: Oh that's a bad idea, there are like *no* jobs in
personality. *(professor turns to computer and does a search on a
higher-ed-jobs site to prove point).*

Act Two: Flats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Time: **5:00** Correspondent K. calls and says, "I have a flat tire,
so I might be a bit late, but everything's ok."
- Time: **5:15** Correspondent E. and tycho exchange car keys so that
the household will be able to fufill all evening commitments in the
event of "everything" not being ok.
- Time: **5:30** Correspondent K. calls and requests roadside
assistance, not, as logic would suggest from the department of
transportation or the american automobile association (AAA), but
rather from Correspondent E; and unsurprisingly tycho.
- Time: **5:31** tycho, and Correspondent E. gather belongings and
winter weather gear and rush out the door.
- Time: **5:45** Correspondent E successfully navigates to the site of
the repair in progress. tycho notes that the car does not even look
to be elevated.
- Time: **5:46** tycho and C.E. descend upon the scene and discover
that the car is indeed jacked, but also find C.K. continuing to
unscrew the hubcap.
- Time: **5:47** tycho and C.E. relieve C.K. of responsibility in this
matter, and admire how shredded the tire became during the 3 mile
drive, at no more than 25 mph.
- Time: **5:55** tycho drives away in the newly repaired car, while
C.'s E. & K. continue on with evening as plan, only slightly colder
than they had indented.

Act Three: Thanks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**tycho** *walks into house at about 6:02pm*

*cellphone rings obnoxiously.* **tycho** *answers*: yes?

**Correspondent K:** Good, you're home.

**tycho**: *silent stare*

**Correspondent K:** I just wanted to make sure you made it home safe.

**tycho** *remains silent*.

**Correspondent K:** you did something nice for me, I just wanted to
check in on you.

**tycho** *wryly*: And this is the thanks I get?
