Sorry Folks, I totally intended to post this earlier, but it languished
in a forgotten folder. How ironic is that.

I think having some sort of archiving post to point to when I'm talking
about the productivity, so here it is. End tying up is always a good
thing. Best, ty

As promised I'm here with a post designed to sum up and provide a
gateway to my series on personal productivity that I called
"Rethinking GTD." I'd been reading the website 43folders for a
while, and while I'd learned a lot of things from this website
including a lot about the GTD system developed by David Allen, I've
often felt that while GTD was the ideal system for a person with a
particular sitatuion there were some of us, notably academics and
writer-types, that the system really didn't work that well for. So I
did some musing, that I'm sure you can all read or not. The links
are below.

-  Part 1: Getting Other Things Done
-  Part 2: Rethinking GTD: My System
-  Part 3: Rethinking GTD: Production Times and "the Zone"
-  Part 4: Rethinking GTD: Review (and A Little Rant About
Footnotes)
-  Part 5: Getting What Done? (An Explanation of “in the generous
sense”)

Just because this is TealArt, and I have a hard time *not* being
reflexive, I guess in retrospect, I realized that GTD has a lot to
offer everyone, and while a different way of organizing lists, when
contextual lists stop working is somtimes indicated, there's a lot
of useful in there... My essays explore a number of key ideas, and I
think are an imporantant note and study in thinking about all the
factors which contribute to their personal productivity, and I think
this level of reflexivity is probably useful if you're struggiling
with this.

I hope you enjoy, or at least are mildy amused.

cheers, tycho
