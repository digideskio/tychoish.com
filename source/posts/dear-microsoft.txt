dear Microsoft Mac office design team,

On the whole I am successful in my project to avoid using your products,
because they are, as tools, not particularly suited to the kinds of ways
that I use my computer. Nevertheless, particularly with regards to
programs like Excel, this is unavoidable. Good job there guys.

Nevertheless, I would like to say that it would be really nice if you
could stop having your program dump temporary files in my documents
folder. I understand your intentions here, but really think that the
"Application Support" folder remains the customary place for such files,
and I'm getting tired of deleting this folder.

thank you for understanding.

warmest regards, tycho
