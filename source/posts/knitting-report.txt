Knitting camp got me back into the knitting, but I haven't written about
it in so long that I think it's only fitting that I write a little bit
about my current projects. Here they are:

1. `Latvian Dreaming <http://tychoish.com/tags/latvain-dreaming/>`__:

   This is the project that I am, at least theoretically, leading a
   follow-the-leader knit-a-long on. But it's the summer, and few
   people are actually follwoing along. Also, I've only written
   instructions until the underarm point, which I just surpassed this
   past weekend, so I'll be posting the *next* step soon. I want to
   put a v-neck on this sweater, and I've not yet really done a
   v-neck successfully, so I want to test some things out before I
   commit to something on this sweater. The good news for all of you
   who want to knit this sweater is that this is still my primary
   project and that I am "unstuck" and making progress.

2. A plain V-Neck/Raglan Sweater:

   For knitting camp this year I started a plain raglan sweater to
   knit on while I was at camp. Needless to say, not only did I not
   knit on this sweater, but I didn't even take it out of the bag. It
   was a good thing that got be back in the mood for knitting, but it
   did cause me to break my "one sweater at a time rule," and is thus
   a little bit distressing for this reason. It's also destressing
   because I'm allergic to the yarn (a merino possum blend) which
   makes me sneeze and feel as if my face was attacked by a fuzzy
   monster. Furthermore it doesn't help that the yarn, which is a
   discontinued Cherry Tree Hill, has an inconsistent level of
   fuzziness, sort of like a dye-lot issue, except with more
   sneezing. Further distressing elements of this design: I have the
   sleeves left to knit at the end; the yoke shaping is always
   mysterious and magical when it is in progress, and I'm using this
   to figure out how to do the v-neck on the latvian dreaming
   pullover.

3. The Never Ending Movie Sweater

   Three years ago I, on a whim, bought a 1.5 pound cone of
   fingering/jumper weight alpaca lambswool. I didn't do much with it
   for a while, but that winter I started making a cabled strip that
   was about 30 stitches wide on US 1 needles. I wasn't sure what it
   was going to be, and in fits and starts I've turned it into a
   sweater. The strip was continued to form a ring, which I picked
   stitches up around and knit the body of a sweater. It's mostly
   plain, and I call it my "movie sweater" because two summers ago, I
   lived with someone who really enjoyed going to movies. While I
   also enjoy going to see movies, I like having knitting, and there
   was enough endless stocking stitch in the round that I could do it
   in the dark. At knitting camp I finished the second shoulder
   strap. Now all that's left is knitting the plackets and collar
   (with lots of cables on them), and then the sleeves. On US 1s. I
   think because this has lingered for so long as a side project,
   that I've never really felt like I needed to finish, I have
   remarkably little stress/angst/worry over this project. Also, a
   fingering weight sweater? How cool is that.

4. Lace Shawls

   I have a couple of lace shawls floating around the house that I
   started at various times because I had the yarn, and/or I needed
   to figure out something. They're low-stress and non-teleological
   (like the movie sweater, and unlike the other two sweaters) and
   it's an interesting change of pace from all the colorwork that
   I've been doing the past couple of years. I've not knit lace in
   years, and I've finally given away all of the shawls that I knit
   during my last lace kick, so it's time to create another little
   stash of these shawls.

I think the 2008-2009 knitting season will be marked by a branching out.
While I think I have a couple of colorwork sweaters in the plan, I'm
going to be knitting from handspun stash and there will be a couple of
cabled sweaters. Though I suspect that I'll write about my knitting
again before I get to that point.

That's what I'm working on at the moment.

What about you?
