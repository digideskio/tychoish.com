Book Recommendations

Sorry about the posting confusion this week. I'll be out on Monday
here and on `Critical Futures <http://criticalfutures.com/>`__, but
everything will be back to normal on Tuesday.

This is a post that I've been working on for a while, and I'm not
sure that it's **done** but I'm fresh out of ideas for more book
recommendations. But then, this is a blog, and there's a comment
form for a reason, so if I've been remiss and forgotten something
important, please do remind me. Enjoy!

I have perpetual fears about not being well read enough. I think this is
mostly an existential problem, as I read a bunch, and I've read a lot of
stuff in my day. But there's always more, particularly as I think about
shifting my academic/intellectual specialty. In any case, I found myself
a few weeks ago recommending a science fiction novel that I *had*
read, [1]_ and I thought it might be good to post a list of
recommendations. Not just "books I like," but "books I'd tell you to
read if you were looking for something specific."

For people who like military SF and some people who like Heinlein, `John
Scalzi's Old Man's
War <http://www.amazon.com/Old-Mans-War-John-Scalzi/dp/0765309408/tychoish-20/>`__
is a great deal of fun.

For a great novella/tightly wound plot, `Samuel R. Delany's Empire
Star <http://www.amazon.com/Babel-17-Empire-Star-Samuel-Delany/dp/0375706690/tychoish-20>`__
and for lingustic sf, the other half of the book,
`Babel-17 <http://www.amazon.com/Babel-17-Empire-Star-Samuel-Delany/dp/0375706690/tychoish-20>`__.
I'm a huge fan. For anyone interested in urban systems and community,
`Times Square Red/Times Square Blue
Amazon <http://www.amazon.com/Times-Square-Red-Blue/dp/0814719201/tychoish-20>`__
is a great read, and is incidentally the most cited source of my college
career.

For a *very* smart, but also very comforting and enjoyable space opera
trilogy, `Melissa Scott's Five-Twelfths of Heaven
Trilogy <http://www.amazon.com/Five-Twelfths-Heaven-Melissa-Scott/dp/0671559524/tychoish-20>`__
can't be beat. Her `Trouble and her
Friends <http://www.amazon.com/Trouble-Her-Friends-Melissa-Scott/dp/0812522133/tychoish-20>`__
is also a great example of what cyberpunk can be when it's not trying
too hard to be the next New Thing.

I don't find myself in a position to recommend mainstream fiction very
much, but I am a big fan of Anne Lamott's `All New
People <http://www.amazon.com/All-New-People-Anne-Lamott/dp/1582430543/tychoish-20/>`__,
and Barbara Kingsolver's `Prodigal
Summer <http://www.amazon.com/Prodigal-Summer-Novel-Barbara-Kingsolver/dp/0060959037/tychoish-20/>`__,
which are both clever and fun, and are unabashedly delightful.

Books about writing? Five or more years ago, I would have had a list of
books about writing, but as a genre I'm not particularly convinced of
their worth/utility or frankly interesting-ness. Anne Lamott's `Bird by
Bird <http://www.amazon.com/Bird-Some-Instructions-Writing-Life/dp/0385480016/tychoish-20>`__,
is simply amazing, though not particularly for the specific writing
related hints. I've always thought that Stephen King's writing book is
pompous and sort of unfocused, but admittedly I couldn't even force
myself to finish it.

That's what come to mind, do you all have any good recommendations?

I'm not above recommending a book on reputation alone, though I try
to disclose this.
