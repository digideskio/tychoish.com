Stroll, Bitch, Ph.D.'s guest blogger made the following observation:

One day cock of the walk; next, a feather duster.

In other news, both James "The Hardest Working Man in Show Business"
Brown and Gerald "The Only Unelected President" Ford, have passed
away in recent days. As we all know, famous deaths come in threes.
So, with sincere sympathies to the families and friends of the
deceased and hopes that they find comfort, I'm telling you: keep
your eyes peeled for Number Three.

(Via Bitch. Ph.D..)

Whose your bet? I heard, I think via tinman about an office game that
involved some sort of betting pool bassed on creating a list of famous
people who were likely to die. I think you got points bassed on who
lived. I recognize that this isn't incredibly useful. Anyway, to bring
this all back together--loosely--does anyone have any ideas for who the
third is?

I think Claude Levi-Struss is too easy of a bet, and Jimmy Carter is
probably not creative enough. I dunno. Thoughts?

In another morbid moment. Over dinner tonight one of our friends,
remarked after having seen "The Queen," about how sad the time following
Princess Dianna's death was.

To which my only memory was that my grandfather, for the next month or
so, when ever you asked him "what's happening," would say "she's still
dead."

I'm sorry you all for being such a sucky blogger. Happy New Years. I
figure that I'm reflexive enough 364 days of the year, that I can spare
you on New Years. Maybe the next catch phrase for this blog will be
"Reflexive on Demand." Actually now that I'm thinking about it, the
current title "Awkward, But Endearingly Colloquial" is an actual comment
that a professor wrote on one of my papers. I thought it was rather
clever. So there.

Anyway, I'll be back with more content soon enough, just you wait.

Cheers!
