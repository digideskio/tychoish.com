A friend asked me a question (several weeks ago by publication) on a
technical topic and I spent most of the next few days writing a missive
on database administration strategy. That seemed like a normal response.
I was delighted to find that: I liked the voice, I enjoyed writing the
longer document, and there are a dozen or so other related topics that I
wanted to explore. So, apparently, I'm writing a book. This is exactly
what I need: more projects. *Not.*

But it's a good thing: I find the writing inspiring and invigorating. I
have a perspective and collection of knowledge that hasn't been
collected and presented in a single place. I like long form writing. The
larger piece might also be a good contribution to my portfolio (such as
it is.)

I think this kind of writing suits my attention span.

This has left me without a lot of spare time for blogging, and (as I'm
prone to do every so often,) rethinking the future of my efforts on
tychoish.com and as a blogger. This is boring for all of you, but I'll
give some higher level stuff here and we can follow up on the
[[discourse]] page:

-  Blogging is fun, and even though I've not been posting regularly, I'm
always writing blog posts. Sometimes I find myself writing posts in
emails to friends, but I'm never really going to stop writing blog
posts.

-  The general explosion of blog publishing that we saw a few years ago
has declined. Audience fragmentation happened, readership got
entrenched. I feel like I weathered the storm pretty well and I'm
really happy with the site and readers I have, but I'm also pretty
confident that blogging isn't going to be the means by which I "level
up." [1]_

-  eBooks have finally happened. For the last decade most people have
been saying that ebooks are great for reference material (given
search-ability,) and for providing an introduction to a text that
people will eventually buy in a paper edition. That may be true, but
I think it's changing rapidly, and with kindles and tablets and
smart-phones, I think eBooks have effectively won, such as it is.

In another ten years, perhaps, we'll just call them books.

-  I'm pretty clear that keeping a blog, and perhaps most of the writing
I do in my spare time is **for my own enjoyment and betterment** and
helps to develop a personal portfolio and account of my work. I have
no (real) interest in using my writing on tychoish.com or any other
side that I maintain, as a way of supporting myself to any greater or
lesser extent.

I want to be in the business of writing things and working with
technology and ideas and people, not the business of publishing. While
the line is not always clear between "writing projects that you publish
yourself online," and "new media publisher," I want to stay away from
the later as much as possible.

So I think this means that most of my "tychoish," writing time will go
to writing this book project, and to fiction, and once my blog post
backlog is fully depleted (heh,) most of my postings will either be
announcements/[[tag/progress-reports]] or a bunch of shorter more
off-the-cuff notes.

Here's hoping at least.

I can't really believe that I just used "level up" in this context.
