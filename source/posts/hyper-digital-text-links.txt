========================
Hyper Digital Text Links
========================

As promised, though somewhat later than I had initially intended I am
here to provide you with a list of links for things about hypertext that
I think you might be interested in. Kind of a "further reading" section,
if you will. Some of these pieces I have thoughts about and i'll include
notes regarding this, but for the most part I just have some resources
that I found helpful and/or interesting. Enjoy!

-  `Steam Punk Magazine <http://www.steampunkmagazine.com/>`__

-  This, ironically, is what started the series. I really like what
SPM has done, and their publication is really quite good looking.
It's all PDF and not "digital" except under the strictest of
technicalities. This isn't a bad thing, but when reading it I
thought, "if this is the best digital production around these days
and it's not really digital, what does this say about the
possibility for digital production?" And I continue to think that
this is an important question to ask.

-  `Cory Doctorow Writes About digital
Reading <http://www.locusmag.com/Features/2007/03/cory-doctorow-you-do-like-reading-off.html>`__

-  Cory Doctorow, is I think working from the very front of a lot of
the questions about digital media consumption and production. Most
of his work, at least what he is known for, is all about digital
intellectual property, but this article about reading from
computer screens is quite good.

-  `Persistent.info <http://blog.persistent.info/>`__

-  This is just another blog, written by a Google employee, and I
include it here because I like the way that the blog posts arrange
themselves in columns if the window width gets to be too big. The
CSS wouldn't work if the text were much longer than it is in the
posts for this site, but it's a nifty idea, none the less.

-  `Textual Instruments <http://turbulence.org/Works/twotxt/>`__

-  A site that has a couple of nifty looking hypertexts, worth
checking out. I haven't *actually* had time to read them yet,
unfortunately.

-  `Fiction Markup
Language <http://www.banapana.com/fiction-markup-language/>`__

-  This is an example of an XML-based langauge for fiction writing,
and it has classes and items for characters, settings, as well as
book/chapter level organization. While I really like the idea
here, I fear that it could be really constraining in terms of
form, and structure. At the same time, the strength of these sorts
of things is in the parser, and I haven't seen one yet, so who
knows. It might be a good format option for editing software like
`Scrivener <http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html>`__
or other software intended for fiction-like writing.

-  `Hypertext Community <http://users.cs.dal.ca/~jamie/hypertext/>`__
-  `Swooter, books via twitter <http://www.booktwo.org/swotter/>`__

-  Swooter is a script that will regularly serialize, via
`twitter <http://twitter.com/>`__, any plain text file. Someone's
using it to serialize James Joyce, but the implications and
possibilities here are pretty nifty. It's like the "read classics
via email" project, but I think the aspiring hypertext author
could do some rather nifty things with this tool.

-  `institute for the future of the book
blog <http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/>`__

-  if:book is a project out of the Annenberg Center that explores and
works on the future of the book (I love good naming schemes), and
their blog is really top notch.

-  `Company Therapist
Hypertext <http://www.thetherapist.com/Introduction.html>`__
-  `Academic Hack Open
Access <http://academhack.outsidethetext.com/home/?p=120>`__

-  Academic Hack talks about open access, which I think could frame
the academic discussion regarding academic publishing in a
productive way. In a lot of ways, I've come to believe that
however the academic publishing "problem" resolves itself will
have important implications for how the mainstream market reforms
in the future, and I'm pretty cofident that academic publishing
will see reform before the mainstream. But you can argue that, if
you want.

-  `Savage Minds: Open Access your
Diss <http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/savageminds/~3/45741381/>`__

-  I think the idea of making dissertations open access is a
wonderful idea. There is so much research that gets done as part
of people's doctoral programs that never sees the light of day.
While I think a lot of people would cringe at the thought (and
frankly I can't go back more than a semester without cringing), it
seems that getting the information out there is worthwhile. If a
dissertation is supposed to form the basis of your first
book/series of articles, then, indeed the instinct is to clamp
down on the diss text; but having said that I think having
dissertations available might make it easier for people to more
productivly move beyond that text, and that could be a good thing.

-  `Making
MediaCommons <http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/index.php?/weblog/more_on_making_mediacommons/>`__

-  Kathleen Fitzpatrick, one of the creators and driving force behind
`MediaCommons <http://www.futureofthebook.org/mediacommons/>`__,
an interesting and very forward thinking model for academic
publishing. At the present time, it's a Media Studies project,
which makes a great deal of sense, but the model can and likely
will be ported to other disciplines, and I look forward to that
with great anticipation.

-  `Word Processors: Stupid and
Inefficient <http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html>`__

-  Allin Cottrell explains/explores the ways that the word-processor
model is ineffective for constructing text in digital
communication, and I think that a lot of these general themes can
be extrapolated to a discussion of writing.

Ok, that's all I have for this time. If you have other hypertext/digital
(textual) media sources, I'd love to read what you have to offer. This
entry also marks the end of the regular hypertext series here, I'll post
a round up next Wednesday, but there'll be the intro to the new series
next week.

Thanks for Reading, tycho
