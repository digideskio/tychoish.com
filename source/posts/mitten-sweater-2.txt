Ok, I promised, and here it is: pictures of my current work in progress.
This is the first new thing that I've worked on months and months, so I
feel like pictures are completely warented.

Note, pictures are intended as utilitarian methods of communication, and
not, art. In the end, we can't all be
`Jared <http://brooklyntweed.blogspot.com>`__, now can we?

Here's the great latvian mitten sweater of 2008. Body first.

Now I think I'm pretty close to being done, despite the fact that I have
to knit two more full repeats of the "hash" motif before I can attach
the sleeves and begin the yoke. (I mentioned that this is going to be a
saddle shouldered cardigan done in an EZ/Meg Swansen style? Right?)

In part because, I've already knit sleeves (which is really more
exciting than I want to talk about.) See them here:

Now you probably knew that if you've been reading the blog, but I just
wanted to reiterate this. The last 5 days have been pretty slow going on
this project, but I think that I'll probably be able to join the sleeves
and the body by saturday. I hope.

I'll clean up some of the other pictures and get them out to you over
the next few days/week. I know how out of character this is for me. I
ask that you neither be too surprised nor grow too accustomed to this.

Onward and Upward!
