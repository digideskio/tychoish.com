Sweater Project Clarifications
==============================

Ok, so I realized that I wasn't incredibly clear in my first post. I've
since written a "here's what you have to do to get started post, but I
think that in my eagerness to get started (and for you to get started,)
there's some prep work that needs to be taken care before folks can
start. So I might as well get that out of the way before I dive in.

And besides you all need time to get things in order.

Other than the beginning cast on directions, I think I'll post a little
bit here and there about other things that might be important to touch
upon. Like things to consider for making a cardigan version, or tips for
resizing, stuff about the design process, fitting, and so forth. I want
to pace the project out so that I don't overload you all with
information that you won't need for many weeks, but also, as there are
large stretches of time when the main direction will be "knit on in
pattern," for a *long* time, I want to make sure there's stuff to post.
Remembering of course that my writing of the pattern depends at least a
little on my knitting speed.

If there's a question or issue you want me to cover be in touch about
that and I'll do my best to fit it in.

Here are some answers to the questions and issues that have come up
(below the fold):

--------------

1. There are a lot of yarn options that will work, and I encourage you
   to resort to your stash if possible. There's more on this coming, but
   just some options.

   - Harrisville Designs Shetland (2/8) (it's 17
     dollars--discountable--a cone at `webs <http://www.yarn.com/>`__,
     though there are other vendors)

   - `Domy Heather <http://www.oldmillyarn.com/orderdavidson.htm>`__ -
     this is what I'm using. It's smaller gauge than most other yarns
     suitable for this project (sort of in the "light fingering
     weight" category) so that will effect sizing, but it's a great
     softer, but still hearty wool.

   - Jamieson's Spindrift and Jameison's and Smith Jumper Weight. Good
     two ply yarn, great for this kind of garment. More colors than
     HD, and the sheep grew up on Scottish soil, if that matters to
     you.  (Jamieson's also makes a 3ply DK weight yarn that's great
     if you want something a little thicker.)

   - A user on ravelry suggested `Ruama finullgarn
     <http://www.denisesneedleworks.com/CategoryPage.html?Category=Finullgarn>`__,
     which is a sturdy fingering-ish weight yarn that looks like it
     would be great for this kind of sweater. Since this is a Latvian
     pattern, I think the scandinavian/baltic yarns fit a bit better
     than the shetland yarns I'm prone to. But it's another good
     option. She also carries some `other scandinavian yarns
     <http://www.denisesneedleworks.com/Yarn.html>`__ of various
     weights which might work well for you

2. I ballpark-ed 2800ish yards, as a yarn requirement, but really
   weight is a more effective measurement. Figure how much by weight
   you think a light-medium weight sweater should weigh (experiment
   with a scale), and calculate backwards from here. A little bit more
   than half of this weight should be the background color (darker)
   and a little bit less than half should be foreground. I usually buy
   way more than I need, even though dye lot is usually not a huge
   issue with such large-run yarns, and in color work it's even less
   noticeable.

3. The key number is 344, which you should divide by your gauge to get
   the expected size. If you can modify your gauge at all, and really
   do need to resize, figure out by how many stitches. If you think
   you can do this adjustment to `the pattern
   <http://www.lulu.com/content/2419399>`__ then have fun, if you need
   help, contact me sooner rather than later.

4. There is no start date. You can start whenever you want.

5. I mentioned this is going to be a sweater, right? Pullover too. You
   can make it into a cardigan, but we'll get into that later.

6. My sweater will use two colors. I'm color blind, and very much a
   boy in terms of dress, so I like the simple/plain (drab? I'll
   accept that.) If you want to do a more complex shading, please feel
   free, and please do share it with the rest of us, but it's not
   something I feel able to design much less support (write about).

7. Tell your friends and share the love. For real it means a lot to me!

8. Check the comment threads, they're generally informative.

9. Be in touch with me about when you start and about your progress,
   as much as for my own edification as anything, but I'd love to be
   able to post a shout out to you all, and keep track of your
   progress and experiences with the rest of the project
   materials. I'm an archivist like that.

Thanks for your support and I look forward to knitting with you!
