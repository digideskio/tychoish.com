"blah blah tycho says he's not a programmer, blah blah." I say stuff
like this (more or less) quite a bit, right? But I know a lot about how
computers work, a lot about how programs are constructed (at least in
the abstract,) and while I've not (really) written code of any note I do
*read* a bunch of code, and can almost always figure out how things
work. So I suppose I should confess that I'm... working on learning how
to program (in my *copious* free time).

I, of course, will keep you posted about this as it progresses, but for
now I'll settle to just explain the origin of this development: I
started using emacs a few months ago, and I found the lisp-dialect that
serves as emacs' extension language to be quite understandable. Maybe
it's something about how emacs programs are written to be hacked on, and
even poorly documented emacs-lisp is rather well documented. I read the
beginning of `an introduction to
haskell <http://learnyouahaskell.com/>`__, and I think it has something
to do with the functional aspects of the language. In any case,
something clicked, and so here I am.
