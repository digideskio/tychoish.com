I seem to have abanded the way that I do "have-done" lists. Read `this
tealart entry <http://tychoish.com/posts/productivity-reports/>`__ for
more on this. I've started writing this kind of thing out in the
notebook but I'm not sure that this is the long term sort of solution.
What I really want is some way of tracking word-counts in an effective
sort of way. I'll have to sort something out soon

I thought it might be interesting to scan moleskin pages into this site,
but the idea has been done and my moleskine usage is more functional
than artistic, so I fear it might be pretty uninteresting.

Also, it's come to my attention that the tag system on TealArt doesn't
work at all and produces lots of 404s. Frankly I don't see a lot of need
for this, so I'll probably be removing it as soon as possible. Unless
the chris wants to change it.

I'm still culling my RSS reading load so I can respond more. I read a
lot of things (or rather I want to), too many in fact but that's part of
the point.

I've been doing battle with linux today, with mixed results. The
flipping drives won't mount.

You'll be pleased to know that I've done pretty well by my projected
todo list.

*Over and out.*
