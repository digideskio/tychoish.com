=======================================
Saved Searches and Notmuch Organization

I've been toying around with the `Notmuch Email
Client <http://notmuchmail.org/>`__ which is a nifty piece of software
that provides a very minimalist and powerful email system that's
inspired by the organizational model of Gmail.

Mind you, I don't think I've quite *gotten* it.

Notmuch says, basically, build searches (e.g. "views") to filter your
email so you can process your email in the manner that makes the most
sense to you, without needing to worry about organizing and sorting
email. It has the structure for "tagging," which makes it easy to mark
status for managing *your* process (e.g. read/unread, reply-needed), and
the ability to save searches. And that's about it.

Functionally tags and saved searches work the way that mail boxes in
terms of the intellectual organization of mailboxes. Similarly the
ability to save searches, makes it possible to do a good measure of
"preprocessing." In the same way that Gmail changes the email paradigm
by saying "don't think about organizing your email, just do what you
need to do," not much says "do less with your email, don't organize it,
and trust that the machine will be able to help you find what you need
when the time comes."

--------------

I've been saying variations of the following for years, but I think on
some level it hasn't stuck for me. **Given contemporary technology, it
doesn't make sense to organize any kind of information that could
conceivably be found with search tools.** Notmuch proves that this
*works*, and although I've not been able to transfer my personal email
over, I'm comfortable asserting that notmuch is a functional approach to
email. To be fair, I don't feel like my current email processing and
filtering scheme is *that* broken, so I'm a bad example.

The questions that this raises, which I don't have a particularly good
answers for, are as follows:

- Are there good tools for the "don't organize when you can search
crew," for non-email data? And I'm not just talking about search
engines themselves (as there are a couple: xapian, namazu), or
ungainly desktop GUIs (which aren't without utility,) but the proper
command-line tools, emacs interfaces, and web based interfaces?

- Are conventional search tools the most expressive way of specifying
what we want to find when filtering or looking for data? Are there
effective improvements that can be made?

- I think there's intellectual value created by organizing and
cataloging information "manually," and "punting to search" seems like
it removes the opportunity to develop good and productive information
architectures (if we may be so bold.) Is there a solution that
provides the ease of search without giving up the benefits that
librarianism brings to information organization?
