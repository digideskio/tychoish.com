NYC Subway Strategy

I have a question for game theory/urban planning/transit geeks, in part
for practical reasons, and in part for a story I'm developing:

Is there some sort of resource that explains "most efferent" rapid
transit rider strategies, perhaps from a game theory perspective?

I've been living in NYC for almost a year, with frequent visits for
about 6 months before that and I've learned things like:

- The physical layouts of a number of station complexes and transfer
points, to facilitate quick/easy transfers.

- A faltering sense of when to take an express and when to take a
local, and when it makes sense to switch.

- A decent sense of which route will be more direct/quicker in a given
situation.

- An acceptable sense of which part of the train you need to be on.

I'm interested in knowing if there is any work aimed at a general
audience that addresses any of these questions, in particular:

- The express/local decision making logic, particularly given
situations like:

- When does it make sense to walk ~5-10 blocks to an express stop
(possibly in the wrong direction,) rather than walk a shorter
distance to a local stop that would require a transfer. (If your
destination is an express stop?)

- At what point in a journey does it make the most sense to transfer
between trains?

- How does time-of-day affect the logic.

- Specific differences (if any) for navigating subway lines with
multiple converging services. (e.g. the "M" with regards to the F and
E, as well as the R with regards to the N in Manhattan.)

- Logic for transferring between non-parallel train services that
intersect at multiple points in a given journey (e.g. in Brooklyn,
vs. Manhattan, if needed for inter-borough trips; E/M; 4,5,6 vs N,
R.)

- Logic for transferring between services that run on the same track
(e.g. in NYC: N/R, E/C, F/M, etc.) with respect to how your journey
overlays the route divergence and convergences.
