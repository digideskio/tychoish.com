Knitting Hate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- I hate all of my knitting projects: the sweater is in the black-hole
  portion of the body, and I still am not absolutely sure how I'm going
  to make the shoulder work.

- I have a second sock that is turning out to be very much not the same
  size as the first sock, despite using the same needles/etc as the
  last sock.

- Resuming the pattern on my color-work sock has not gone as
  efficiently as I had initially hoped. And there might be tinking
  back, and I still don't know how to pick up the pattern in the right
  way.

Other Things
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- *Teh Tiereds* (The tiredness) hits at like 10pm these days.

- My LaTeX mojo was having some problems earlier: quite annoying.

- I'm updating my iTunes for the first time in weeks and possibly
  months. I'm currently downloading 125 podcasts... Egad folks.

- I've started spinning again, and I very much want my own wheel again.
  I'm in the process of consolidating my flock, and if I can sell one
  or two of these wheels I can get a new one. I can hardly wait. (This
  is connected to the last part because spinning and podcasts go
  together in my mind.)

- GRE on monday eek.

- Other graduate school things. eek squared.

- My computer has been (likely due to downloading and the GRE prep
  software) kind of lagging. I want a new Mac Book hard core now.
  Interestingly I'm not exactly chomping at the bit to upgrade to
  Leopard. Mostly I think because I don't want to disturb the tenuous
  balance that keeps my system running.

- My battery life has fallen off significantly in the past few months,
  and I think it's time to get a new one. I think that even if I get a
  new computer someone in this house will use Zoe I (I've already
  decided that the new computer will be called Zoe II), so it's not a
  very bad investment, unless of course, she goes up into flames at
  some point. I better go back up things.

Cheers!
