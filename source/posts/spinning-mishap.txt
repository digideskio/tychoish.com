Spinning Mishap

So, I have something rather embarrassing to report, but I think the
blogging medium is generally pretty well suited to this kind of thing.

So I was spinning--we had a friend over to teach spinning to--and I
needed to get my spinning off of a bobbin, and well, as I was winding
off, the singles broke (not entirely uncommon) and for the first time
since the second month that I was spinning, I completely lost the end,
and had to *cut the spinning off the bobbin*.

Thankfully, I only lost about 12 grams of fiber, but it is still
somewhat embarrassing.

I generally consider myself to be a fairly adept spinner, I've been
doing it for a while, and I thought that I was done with this kind of
thing. Apparently not so much.

**sigh**
