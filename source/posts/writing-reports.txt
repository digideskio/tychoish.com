I'm still writing, even though I've been in a very clear `Critical
Futures <http://criticalfutures.com>`__ kick of posting lots of old
material. I think I might post another one of the `Trailing
Edge <http://criticalfutures.com/projects/trailing-edge>`__ stories
soon, just to switch things up, after another `Knowing
Mars <http://criticalfutures.com/projects/knowing-mars>`__ story. But
that's beside the point. So I'm writing this new story. It's good fun,
and there are lots of things about this story that I absoutly adore. The
theory is interesting, the characters are a hoge podge of old favorites
(sort of), the setting is great fun, and I really like the shape of the
plot.

I'm not writing about it on the blog because I think it's too
introspective, and I don't want to overthink things, and I'm not sure
it's going to end up on Critical Futures, and so forth. But I wrote a
sentence which makes me smile, so I thought I'd post it here.

Such strict adhearance to parlaimentray rules wasn't incredibly
common and tended to irritate the old timers, who were firmly of the
opinion that procedure was to be used as a precision instrument, not
a blunt object.

I have something of a fascination with parlimentary systems and
procedures, and I think it's sort of an interesting setting for part of
a story. You have the sense that something "important" is happening
(even if it's not,) you have a bunch of smart folks who we can imagine
might be prone to saying sort of witty things to/at eachother, there's
conflict, and there's a great likleyhood that absurd things can happen.

Having said that, I've been dragging on this scene, which I know will be
fun to write once it gets going. But it hasn't yet. In due time. In due
time.
