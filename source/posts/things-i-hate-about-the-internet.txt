things I hate about the internet

In light of my otherwise fried state of mind, I would like to present a
list of things that I dislike. Because I'm snarky like that.

- HTML emails. I've yet to send or receive an email that really
*requires* rich text formatting provided by HTML emails. While
multi-part emails (which send multiple copies of the same email in
rich and plain text) are a good thing, it's a huge pain in the ass to
get an email (particularly a long email) three times, just for the
pleasure.

- Sites that recreate twitter without adding any useful features or
discussion. It's as if the dimwitted internet people said "holy shit,
if we give people 140 characters to say banal things on *our* site
maybe we'll get traffic like twitter," except this isn't how the
internet has *ever* worked (or worked well.)

Facebook is coming out with "usernames," I've gotten an invitation to
microblog on niche-social networking site, and everyone seems hard set
on reimplementing this whole "status" thing a la twitter in the
beginning, without any thought of interpretation (a la laconica) or
doing something cool like jaiku-style threads, let alone the *next* big
thing.

- Malformed emails. Dudes. Sending a plain text email is really simple,
there's no excuse for it to look like your cat took a nap on the tab
key. I'm not chiding anyone for neglecting to test every email
"blast" they send (because I'd be that lazy) but I am chiding folks
for not testing it *once*. Writing a text file and sending it isn't
that hard.

- Reimplementation of email. I really hate getting facebook messages,
and direct messages on [microblogging service], and each and every
other fucking social networking site. Just send me email. Real email.
It works, I have a good process for dealing with it, and I don't have
to screw around with anything. Thanks.

- The Twitter Fail Whale. Dudes. There was a while about a year ago,
when a bunch of geeks were sitting around and thinking, "you know
this twitter technology is going to be really cool, and there are a
lot of possibilities here," and there were, and I suppose there still
are, but the truth is that I see the fail whale several times every
day, and most of the cool things that I wanted to see in twitter two
years ago and then a year ago (real xmpp support, track, federation,
custom filtered feeds (a la LJ-style friends' filters),) still
haven't materialized. I think the addition of
`OAuth <http://oauth.net/>`__ is a great thing, but it's a baby step.

- The continued prevalence of IRC. Dudes discover jabber/xmpp. Thanks.
A while back, I had a lot of nostalgia for IRC, and its true that IRC
has a lot of history and is a standard to be reckoned with, but
jabber is so much more elegant, secure, and provides features
(persistence, logging, independence, etc) without having net-splits
and complicated ad hoc registration schemes.

That's all for now. What do you hate about the internet?
