Things I've Forgotten to pack

1. The annotated version of the novella that I was hoping to get some
editing of done during this trip. Sigh.
2. Ink cartridges for my Fountain Pen. Particularly unfortunate is the
fact that I use a pen with a non-standard cartridge. Suck.
3. A razor. feh.
4. Waste yarn for setting stitches aside on. Grr.

**Update on 2:** I've discovered that there's actually a pen store that
carries ink in town, but it's in a mall and I *so do not* want to waste
any time in that venture, but we'll see.
