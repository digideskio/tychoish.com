Reviving Old Material

In addition to TealArt I have a secret second virtual life (how sad is
that phrase) as a list-mod for a couple of mid-sized email lists. It
makes sense, email listservs represent a certain backbone of the what
the internet is for me, and while there is never enough time, when I
find one that I like, or one grows into something really cool, I like to
hold on to it for as long as possible.

Back in high school I started a `science fiction writer's
list <http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/sf-writing>`__ on `yahoo
groups <http://groups.yahoo.com>`__ called
`SF-Writing <http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/sf-writing>`__, and it grew
and while it's sort of gone fallow for a while, this list has been
really important forum for me over the years. I recently posted a
question that I think is sort of interesting there and I want to reprint
it, and add a little reflection, so here we go:

I recently pulled out the first 13 pages of the novel (my first)
that I wrote 4 years ago, that I think contains something useable,
that I want to play with in the coming weeks, I think there's a
project in there, and I had forgotten it for a long time.

I wrote this book, and it told an ok story, frankly it wasn't that
interesting, but after I finished it, but before I abandoned it, I
wrote this prologue, written from the perspective of one of the
characters in the novel (after the events of the story), as a sort
of historical essay. Frankly it was boring as hell, out of place,
and more of a sort of "formal outline" My hope is that I can can do
better if I just focus on this small little piece of the story.

Ironically, it would mean writing a Mars book, which it might just
be time for. Jeff and I talked about this a while ago, and I think
we even talked about it on the list, but there's a certian tradition
of SF writers writing a "Mars Book" (eg. Heinlein's stuff,
Bradbury's Chronicles, etc.). But that's not the question I hope to
pose.

I read the chunk that I spoke about in this part of the message a last
night, and I realized that the story I thought it told was really only a
small portion of what was contained in that section. It's a funny thing
memory.

Here's the question I posed to the list. More writing related and
specific than not, but I think there are a number of larger issues that
linger around these experiences.

Do you all revive old works that flounder or do you plow forward?
How long do you let projects go fallow before coming back to them.
And finally do you revise and amend and edit, or do you rewrite and
re- imagine?

It's interesting to work on new and different projects, or at least
break out of my habit of only writing for TealArt.

I'm getting my wisdom teeth out tomorrow morning, so while there will be
a Deleuze essay on Friday, I'm going to be pretty absent for a few days.
Hang in there!

Cheers, ty
