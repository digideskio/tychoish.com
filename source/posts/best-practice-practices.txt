Best Practice Practices
=======================

At work people often ask for more "best practices" guides. In some ways
this is sign of success: they're no longer begging for fundamental
reference material and descriptions of basic use. Nevertheless I almost
always wince:

1. "Best practices" carries an implicit sense of guarantee along the
lines of "if you adhere to the best practices, then you won't run
into problems," which is sort of difficult to assert with confidence,
and is really a product design issue, not a documentation issue.

2. It is really hard to make one-size-fits-all recommendations.

3. Best practice-guides don't address actual needs of users, or actual
solutions to real problems, because they generalize problems and
solutions beyond the point of re-usability.

This isn't to say that it's difficult or impossible to give
recommendations, and indeed documentation *is* the best way that the
purveyors of software have to to shape practices. However, the
documentation should guide users towards better practices *everywhere*
and isolating recommendations into certain types of documents is
probably counter productive.

Onward and Upward!
