... from blogging. See [[/rhizome/on-my-return-to-blogging]] for the
background.

I sometimes look at other people's blogs, and think "wow, that's sharp,"
and while I really like the current tychoish theme, there's a distinct
lack of gradients, really polished typography, strong crisp lines, and
elegant side bars.

*Not that I have a clue what I'd put in a side bar:* Hell, I can't even
find good things to put in the Cyborg
Institute](http://cyborginstitute.net) side bar. But it's not just that
my design has grown dated (I don't think it has, that much,) and more
that the practice of blogging has changed in a few ways:

The State of Blogging
---------------------

-  self-hosted blogs are the exception rather than the rule.

-  it's become increasingly difficult to aggregate content, the demise
of Google Reader, both the removal of the product and the declining
trend it its use point to the idea that RSS isn't a user facing
transmission method.

People are getting content through other means, and publishers probably
can't depend that users will poll *any* content, which changes the role
of the publishing system.

-  In fact, I don't have a real clue what the current state of the art
for publishing tools for blogs is these days. My sense is that a
greater portion of blogs are hosted on services like Tumblr and
WordPress.com.

The big "advancements," in blogging technology are probably related to
integration and distribution of content to third party systems, which
services can probably do better than hosted solutions.

-  There are fewer long-lived personal blogs, and even fewer that stray
beyond a single niche.

Are there blogs that you read regularly? How do you know when there's a
new post?

Changes Afoot
-------------

Given these changes, and the chance to rethink how I approach this blog:

-  I'm curious as to the state of commenting and discourse related to
blogs. Do people actually comment, in anything other than exceptional
situations? Are most conversations on hacker-news/reddit or other
domain specific common space and other blogs?

I've been thinking about the prospect of even turning off the
discussion/discourse pages here. They don't get used, they're kind of
weird, people don't really know how to use them, and I'm not sure they
get used. At the same time, providing a space for conversation seems
essential. More on this on a later post.

*Edit:* I totally did this, and while I have some regrets, I think it's
generally a good move.

-  While it'd be nice to automate submitting content to various
aggregation sites and social network-sites, I've added various
browser extensions to do these submissions. It's a pain in the ass,
but I guess auto-submits makes for less useful content aggregator.

-  Just as tagging systems are inefficient and broken for wikis and
"real" technical resources (see [[/rhizome/taxonomic-failure/]] for
my thoughts,) they're not all that great for blogs. I'm considering
completely removing the tagging system on tychoish, and just letting
the search tool (which is pretty good) make content easy to discover.

Onward and Upward!
