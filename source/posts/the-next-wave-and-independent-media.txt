The Next Wave and Independent Media

I posted a link to an article `about the professionalization of
blogging <http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200909u/professional-bloggers>`__
in an earlier `link dump
post <http://tychoish.com/posts/links-postpublishing-gender-posthumanism>`__,
that I've been thinking about rather a lot in recent days, and I wanted
to reflect on this.

The argument of the article, which I think is pretty much spot on,
discusses how contemporary blogging has become this thing that that
isn't just the sort of thing that "nobodies" can throw up a blog with
WordPress and become an Internet sensation in fairly short order. Now
setting aside the fact that this might `never have been true in the
first
place <http://tychoish.com/posts/3-odd-properties-of-blogging>`__, I
think there's some serious merit to this argument: blogs have gone
mainstream, lots of people read blogs, and the people who have the
resources to write blogs tend to be people groups of people who have a
lot of resources, and most of the popular/successful blogs these days
require a lot of resources and sustained energies.

This isn't a bad thing, of course, but I think it forces us to rethink
what it means to be a blogger writer "internet content producer" both in
the current moment and looking to the future.

There are a number of different factors contributing to this larger
moment. Some of the more prevalent ones are:

- **There are more blogs now today than there used to be,** this means
  both that the "cost of entry" is higher than it was five years ago
  or even a year ago. This means new blogs will:

  - *Need to focus on more unique subject areas*, this is the "long
    tail" or "embrace your niche" approach. Rather than be the most
    popular blogger on Technoratti (do people still care about
    technoratti?) be the most popular blogger in the homemade
    breakfast cereal niche.

  - *Blogging can't be the casual thing that it was in the beginning,*
    In the early days people started blogs and posted occasionally and
    it was just this novel little thing, and they were able to be
    successful as bloggers. Now, blogging is something that one really
    has to dedicate an embarrassing amount of energy to to be
    successful.

- **The "Blog" as a literary genre, or media forum has become much
  more cemented**, so that rather than be this experimental form that
  really only describes a website that updates regularly in a
  serialized format, there are now a whole host of expectations
  regarding the forum.

  - *Blogs that reject the primacy of these forms will tend to be more
    successful,* in that readers will tend to find them more
    innovative.  Forum and approach, as much as a subject area, is one
    way that small independent content producers will be able to
    differentiate themselves from "big media blogs."

  - *Blogs can be projects onto themselves.* We've seen a convention
    where every site uses a blog as a way of providing more up-to-date
    content, but independent bloggers are able to create independent
    blogs which accent other projects, but are nonetheless
    *independent* and self contained texts.

- **Independent bloggers might not be able start up and field vast
  readerships on their own any more, but may be able to define their
  success on their own terms.** Old media business models, that rely
  on `advertising revenue
  <http://tychoish.com/posts/the-collapse-of-marketing>`__ and large
  readership numbers might not be the most stable anyway, and
  independent bloggers may be able to contemplate success on their own
  terms. Possible "new media" definitions of success include:

- Using a blog to support and promote a consulting or services based
  business, by presenting general information to help justify your
  expertise in a given area. Think `RedMonk
  <http://www.redmonk.com/>`__, `Merlin Mann
  <http://www.43folders.com/>`__, and in some ways, me.

- Using a blog (and its moderate audience) to support some sort of
  "rockstar" business model, where you sell something (tickets to
  shows, dead-tree books, tshirts, etc.) that people mostly want
  because they know you from something which doesn't make you much
  money (ie. record sales, blogging.)

There's more. And I think that I might be talking about this kind of
thing at `PodCamp 3 Philly <http://www.podcampphilly.com/>`__. I'd love
to see you there.
