I taught the second session of my knitting class yesterday, and was
generally pretty pleased with the outcome. The two people in my class
seemed to get what I was teaching, and although I might have expected
them to get a little further in their projects, they seemed pleased and
had a handle on how their projects would continue, and if they're happy,
well then, by gosh I'm happy too.

In even greater news, I agreed to teach another class in two weeks time,
on toe-up socks and/or stranded/2-color socks. While I'm an avid toe-up
sock knitter, I have yet to completely master the stranded-toe up
sock [1]_. This meant that I came home and promptly (well almost) cast
on for a toe up sock. This time it came off better. My trick: I'm
knitting it at the same gauge as the sweaters I make, because I realized
I tend to knit those, ahem, *firmly*, so no need to knit foot armor.

I have to say that this stranded sock things is really kind of fun,
although I'm going to need to unvent/invent a new toe, to deal with the
"stranded knitting stitches are square" issue.

In other knitting news: I finished the first sleeve and the colar of the
red-and-black sweater I was working on at camp, and over the last week
the stranded sweater I was working on at camp has grown to be about 10
inches, but otherwise nothing exciting.

At the moment I'm focusing on getting projects done so I can start new
things, like an Armenian design, or more stranded socks. I'll post
pictures at some point, I swear [2]_.
