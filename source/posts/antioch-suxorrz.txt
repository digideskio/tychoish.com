Or, **Yet another reason I'm glad I didn't go to Antioch:**

`Adjunctification of
Antioch <http://insidehighered.com/news/2007/06/26/antioch>`__:

Antioch College faculty members have noted these patterns with some
dismay, and their allies fear that the university%u2019s board is
intentionally trying to remove tenure. Officially, Antioch College
could be reborn in some new form in 2012, after shutting down in
2008, and that four-year gap has people speculating about an
underlying opposition to tenure. Under AAUP guidelines, an
institution that eliminates tenured positions after declaring
financial exigency has an obligation to offer any new jobs back to
tenured professors who lost positions %u2014 but that obligation
lasts for only three years.
