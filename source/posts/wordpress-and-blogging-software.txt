WordPress and Blogging Software
===============================

As you might know, we at TealArt, use a program called WordPress to run
the back-end of the site. It's a nifty program, and I've started to see
`WordPress <http://wordpress.org/>`__ blogs all over the place, and it
seems like WordPress might even be the blogging software of choice for
most folks these days. I had the pleasure/distinction of having to
upgrade the software the other day, which has started to keep wordpress
pretty firmly in my mind.

Thing is, most of the time I don't really interact with the software:
there are so many programs and options that make it possible to post and
edit a blog without ever actually having to go to the website, these
days I use `MarsEdit <http://ranchero.com/marsedit/>`__ and a plugin for
my text editor, `TextMate <http://macromates.com/>`__ to post to the
blog. This is of course super interesting to you so I'm going to move
on. [1]_

I remember when WordPress was the rogue stepchild of
`b2/cafelog <http://cafelog.com/>`__ (another wonderful piece of blog
software that `TealArt <http://tychoish.com/>`__ proudly used), and even
when the thought of having a site as dependent on a
`mySQL <http://www.mysql.com/>`__ database as WP sites tend to be was
absurd. These days, Word Press is one of **the** successes of the open
source software scene. Tons of people use it. It works great, it's
polished, there's an active developer community, and somehow the leaders
of the project are able to support some sort of business model. There
are probably a lot of reasons for this:
`PHP <http://www.php.net/>`__/`mySQL <http://www.mysql.com/>`__ are easy
languages to learn, the back end and the front end of WP are basically
independent of eachother, and the way that WP does plugins makes it easy
for people to contribute to WP, and also for WP developers to roll-in
particularly successful plug-ins as features.

I'm not versed enough in this, but the
`WP.com <http://www.wordpress.com>`__/`WP.org <http://www.wordpress.org>`__
distinction is I think a great model for distributing and monitoring
"free" software. Basically they develop a product that they give away
for free (WP.org; what TA uses), and then they take that product and
offer a service related to that product (WP.com) that they can generate
revenue with. You can read the Automatic website for more information,
frankly I'm not sure about the particulars, or if it's really a viable
business model but I'd like it if it were, so I'm going to continue to
pretend.

Interestingly, also, they're enough different from their major comerical
competitor (`SixApart <http://www.sixapart.com/>`__, the people who do
`LiveJournal <http://www.livejournal.com/>`__, Vox,
`TypePad <http://technorati.com/tag/typepad>`__ and most importantly
`MoveableType <http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/>`__,) that they'll
probably not run into problems there. I'm not entirely sure about
MoveableType's long term success, but at this point that's not a very
big issue.

Anyway, enough yammering for now... I'll be back tomorrow with the intro
for the new series! Don't go anywhere.

Best, tycho

The sad part about this paragraph is that I think it probably mirrors
the way I talk/think with an all too depressing amount of truth.
