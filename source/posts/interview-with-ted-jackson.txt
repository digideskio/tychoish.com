- **Who are you? What do you?**

  I'm a grad student at Washington University until the end of this school
  year when I will have hopefully finished and defended my dissertation on
  Hermann Hesse. In general, I'm really interested in modernism
  specifically, but I'll take an intellectual stab at about anything
  written from 1890 to the present. Despite being a humanist, I'm a bit of
  a computer geek: I'm writing my dissertation in LaTeX and a religious
  Lifehacker reader. I don't really do code, though, apart from the
  occasional Automator action or Applescript.

  Someday I would like to have a real job and maybe another cat or, dare I
  say, a first kid? I love a good book, but usually something that is a
  balance between complicated/dry and entertaining. I can tolerate a lot
  of craziness in a book, but let's face it, *Ulysses* is incredible
  though not exactly fun reading.

  I'm an avid knitter and sometimes spinner. I learned when I was about 6
  or 7 from my great aunt, had a long hiatus, and started again in about
  2004 with a pair of really loose socks. I also have a bin of worms in my
  apartment that compost food for me. Oh, and I love my cat, Dot.

- **Merino vs. Blue-faced Leicester?**

  Blue-faced!

- **Lets talk about technology: What kind of technology do you use, and
  what's the coolest thing that technology enables for you? What about
  your technology do you find frustrating?**

  I'm a total mac person, but I dabble in open-source things. My favorite
  ability at the moment is to be able to sync bookmarks and notes to my
  computer and iphone via Evernote. I'm hoping I don't tire of it. I'm
  very forgetful, so knowing what's on my grocery list at any given time
  is awesome. I've even got a notebook of knitting ideas and patterns on
  there.

  I find Twitter completely frustrating, yet I find myself tweeting all
  the time. I've tried about 5 different clients, but none of them hide
  the messages I've already read and keep them hidden between computer and
  phone. Then there are those folks who write drivel constantly, but I
  can't unfollow them because I'm afraid they'd be offended. The worst,
  though, is that people think it's an acceptable form of news reporting.

- **Favorite book you've read in the last year? Runners up?**

  My favorite book for the last couple years has been Donna Tartt's *The
  Secret History*. I'm thinking about reading it again, that's how much I
  liked it! I tried and got through 3/4ths of *Crime and Punishment* this
  summer, but have since abandoned it. Right now I'm reading *Smilla's
  Sense of Snow*.

- **Favorite Website?**

  `icanhazchezburgur <http://icanhascheezburger.com/>`__ although my
  browser says that I visit `Ravelry <http://www.ravelry.com>`__ more
  often!

- **What do you think was the most important event of the last 15
  years?**

  It's really hard to even begin to answer this question, but I suppose I
  have to give it a shot. I'd say it is probably the proliferation of
  wireless phones. Especially with the ability to take pictures and send
  text messages internationally, hostile leaders and regimes can no longer
  squelch the voices of their people. Honestly, in 1994 I never imagined
  myself owning a cell phone, let alone one that would be able to let me
  surf the internet or send email. For that matter, even when I was in
  college, email attachments were problematic: I also wouldn't have
  imagined me writing my dissertation in a city five hours away from my
  advisor.

- **The next 10?**

  This will be us as a society learning to deal with this technology,
  especially for the type of people not used to teaching themselves to use
  new technology. Some people, like my parents, are slowly adapting to a
  digital lifestyle and are even fascinated with new gadgets without being
  pressured by people like me. I never considered myself a computer
  person, though, but rather one who could read the instruction manual. So
  much of the new technology assumes the user has a basic grammar of what
  it means to interact with a machine. Graphics replace text menus, and
  all of a sudden squares and triangles are essential instead of quick
  references. What this also means is that people like my grandparents may
  soon be completely left in the dark. I find it laughable that stacks of
  paper phone books still show up on my building's doorstep, but my
  grandparents would have no idea of how to find a phone number, even if
  they had a computer.

- **One thing that you're most looking forward to in the next year?**

  I'm very excited about finishing my dissertation and to finally become
  what my family refers to as "Dr. Ted".

- **One thing that you wish you could learn?**

  I would really like to be good at yoga, enough to give me exercise in
  the winter time and relaxation in the summer. I always feel like I will
  have to spend a fortune on lessons or classes. I've tried watching
  tapes, but I need someone to bend my legs and put my feet where they are
  supposed to go.

- **Hegel vs. Heidegger?**

  Hegel wins in my book because I use his dialectic *all* the time. Sadly,
  I don't know much about Heidegger at all.
