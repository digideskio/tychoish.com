I saw a meme, I from
`lesboprof <http://lesboprof.blogspot.com/2009/03/authors-meme.html>`__,
that listed 25 authors that were influential to her. It was fun for me
to read, because there was some overlap with what my list would be and
because she's (presumably) a feminist-studies type as well. I thought
I'd give it a stab, though in typical tychoish fashion, this is going to
be really eclectic. Also, because it's a meme, please feel free to
comment and join in.

1.  Samuel R. Delany - Delany was probably the single most cited author
during my college career, and was my root back into science fiction
after college. Good stuff, because it combines feminist/queer/race
theory interests with science fiction.

2.  Kim Stanley Robinson - My "intro to college" class was built around
Robinson's "Mars Trilogy." While I put the books out of mind for
many years, I've recently come back to them, and am surprised how
much my own "Mars stories" draw on Robinson's influence to varying
degrees. His work is Masterful and I quite enjoy it.

3.  Gayle S. Rubin - Rubin's essay "Thinking Sex," really defined my
interest in queer studies and queer theory, and remains terribly
important to my world view.

4.  Melissa Scott - I read the "Silence Leigh" trillogy when I was in
high school (twice!), and it rocked my world, seriously rocked my
world. I've read two of her other books more recently, and was
similarly influenced by them. Good stuff.

5.  Anne Lamott - Contemporary/mainstream fiction isn't often my thing,
nor are (particularly) memoirs; however, I find Anne Lamont's
fiction (and non-fiction) quite powerful. Someone got me *Bird by
Bird* as a gift, and I ate it up (again, during high school). I've
since read more of her work, and I'm particularly fond of *All New
People*.

6.  Issac Asimov - I read the Foundation series twice in high school and
it was amazing. There's so much more Asimov out there, and while I'm
not on a huge project to "read the SF canon," every time I come
across an Asimov story it often succeeds at being really awesome.

7.  Robert Heinlein - In high school I took a class where I had to read
Like 12 books in 4 months (sophomore year.) It was intense and I
swear the only book I finished reading for that class was *Stranger
in a Strange Land.* It's good. I'm not a particular Heinlein fanboy,
and a lot of his material creeps me out, but

8.  Cherie Moraga - I have a copy of Cherrie Moraga's *Loving in the War
Years* next to my desk and it's a book that I find incredibly
powerful. Many, I think remember and cite Moraga's work with Gloria
Anzald√∫a (*This Bridge Called My Back*) which is indeed powerful
stuff, but her creative work hit me a couple of times during
college, and I think I'm better for it

9.  Elizabeth Zimmerman - I knit the way I do because of Elizabeth, and
I think about my knitting seriously because of Elizabeth.

10. Meg Swansen - See above only more so.

11. Paul Connerton - I read this little book called *How Societies
Remember,* in this nifty seminar I took durring my last semester on
historiography, which was one of the very few classes I took in
college "just cause I wanted to," and it was a great thing indeed.
This book was a collecting point for a lot of the cultural identity,
cultural memory ideas that guided my thinking durring the first two
attempts at graduate school (long story), and much to my surprise
continue to affect my thoughts

12. Orson Scott Card - I listened to an interview with OSC last week and
he said that he recomended the "Speaker for the Dead" (post-*Ender's
Game* trillogy) for people over age 18. I was certianly much younger
than that when I plowed through all of the (at the time) existing
Ender Books. I think I was 14 or so when I read all of them. In any
case, big effect.

13. James Tiptree, Jr. - I named my cat (Kip) after a character in
*Brightness falls from the Air*. I don't think I need to say much
more than that.

14. Cory Doctorow - A huge force in contemporary science fiction, and
despite the fact that I think our politics are at least mildly
divergent (and as a result I find a lot of his more political
fiction frustrating), he's a great influence.

15. Barbara Kingsolver - I've not read the complete bibliography, for
sure, but I read a couple of her books in high school, and do quite
enjoy her writing on a stylistic level.

16. Nancy Kress - Amazing. Kress was on my radar before college, but
I've really started to read her work since my return to SF. I quite
enjoy her blog, and I learn something about writing short fiction
every time I read one of her stories.

17. Arthur C. Clarke - I worried about picking too many canon names.
It'd be like a theatre type saying "I'm really into Anouilh,
Shakespeare and Johnson." Frankly, however, I think it's true that a
lot of the--particularly science fiction--that really influenced me
on this list were things that I read when I was in high school. I
think it's something more to do with "that stage," but Clarke's good
stuff.

18. Armisted Maupin - *The Tales of the City* books are an amazing
thing. I spent a week one summer, sitting in a chair, where I'd get
a bottle of water, some crackers, and I'd just read book after book.

19. Irving Yalom - I have of course mentioned on this site that I
majored in psychology in college. Throughout most of this period, I
wasn't particularly interested in clinical work, despite the fact
that all of my classmates were. In any case, the last semester I
took a class on a clinical/treatment topic, and while all of my
classmates who so wanted to help other people gave reports on
depression, and anxiety, and personality disorders; I gave a report
on Death, Dying, and Grief, through which I discovered Yalom, and I
think as a result gave one of the more uplifting reports in the
class. Changed my world.

20. Judith Butler - Not much to say, except I spent a lot of time with
Butler's work in college, and like so much of the feminist and queer
stuff that I read then, has really shaped my thinking. Butter, had a
great impact for better or for worse on a lot of people, an I'm one
of them.

21. David Eddings - I seem to have a thing for "books I read in high
school," particularly long series. I read one of Edding's major
sagas and it was delightful. I also enjoyed one of his non-fantasy
books as well, somewhat later. I'm not a big fantasy lover, and but
I do like saga's and Eddings tells a damn good story.

22. Ken Macleod - If I'm only half as cool as Ken Macleod when I grow
up, I'll be one happy camper.

23. F. Scott Fitzgerald - Ok, I must confess, I read *The Great Gatsby*
once in high school, and I'm convinced that this is **the** Great
American Novel.

24. Theodor Holm Nelson - He wrote a book on hypertext that you probably
haven't heard about called *Literary Machines,* but it's hugely
inspiring in both it's scope and vision.

25. Lionel Bacon - He collected dance notes and music for Morris
dancing. While it's not the kind of thing that you read, it is the
kind of thing that my team has at every practice just in case we
need some sort of arbiter.
