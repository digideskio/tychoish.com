... for the class I'm teaching in two weeks. I need to make version 2.0
and a mate for this sock. I think in that order, but in any case I think
that I'm going to have enough yarn left over to make the second sock,
which I wasn't entirely expecting.

It was my main project, and I finished it in a bit more than 2 days.
Which is kind of cazy. I never finish socks so quickly. The downside?

I'm compleatly beat, and I haven't been blogging and writing as much.
which makes me sad. There'll be a new station keeping
`here <http://tychoish.com/hanm/>`__ soon. Also, my friends from
knitting camp have added a picture of my shawl to `our camp
blog <http://knittingcamp-2007.blogspot.com/>`__. I'm touched! Thanks!

Cheers.
