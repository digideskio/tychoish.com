So I think I've finally gotten into reading *The Left Hand of Darkness,*
so I think this attempt at reading it will be successful. I've posted my
`feminist sf post about
difference <http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=320>`__, spurred on by
starting to read this book (again).

The post ponders the ways that feminist SF approaches and resolves
issues surrounding "difference," does feminist (or) SF say, "look here
are people that are different," and then look at all the ways that
difference leads to disparity (as cyberpunk and other dystopias tend
to,) or the way that differences (between, say men and women) pale in
comparison to the differences between aliens and human, (Which strikes
me as a little assimilationist). I'm not sure what the "answer" is, but
if we had answers, we wouldn't have a blog...

In other media consumption news, while I `posted my thoughts on BSG and
torchwood <http://tychoish.com/posts/television/>`__, I'm also more
slowly working my way through
`Jeremiah <http://worldsofjms.com/jeremiah/index.htm>`__, a show written
by JMS, the same guy who write Babylon 5. While I like the concept, and
I think it's a fun show, I'm ten episodes in, and the pacing of the
story feels "off." The episodic story lines aren't that gripping, and
the story arch moves too slowly. As I think about it, Babylon 5 was
probably the same way, but there are seemingly more space opera stories
than there are, post-apocalyptic dystopian stories.

In the end this means that I've had a hard time mustering the proper
entertainment materials to get me through the dark tunnel part of this
knitting. Surely there are
`NCIS <http://www.tv.com/ncis/show/16772/episode_listings.html>`__
episodes or some such that I haven't seen. I'll post more about the
sweater later. TV recommendations are most welcome.

Onward and Upward!
