I have a hard time passing up a significant calendar event as an
opportunity to reflect and synthesize past experiences. Having said
that, while I had a pretty good year, it was not a year of *big*
changes. There were a lot of pretty interesting and fun smaller changes
and developments in my world and my projects in the last year. In no
particular order:

- This was the year that I went from being "someone who tinkers on
  code" to being someone who can write code when the situation calls
  for it. This felt like an revolutionary change as it happened, but I
  recognize now that it has been a long time coming and in retrospect

- This was the year where I finally slayed my copy quality woes. I've
  long struggled with producing clean copy (English text) in a
  reasonable amount of time (without spelling/grammar errors.) A couple
  years ago, I got to a point where I could write clean copy but it
  felt like I had to spend hours being neurotic. Now, I've trained
  myself to catch things in much more quickly. I'm not perfect, but
  it's no longer something that I feel like I struggle with constantly.

- I reevaluated my relationship with my hobbies and avocational
  pursuits. I decided to spend more time learning about technology and
  computer science, I decided to spend less time writing science
  fiction and less time knitting. I decided to prioritize my
  social/folk times to go to more singings both in town and out of
  town, and focus my dancing around spending time with my friends
  rather than dancing for the sake of dancing.

- This was the year that I decided to stay in New York City. I've been
  here for almost three years now, and I like living here. While I can
  envision living somewhere else in the right situation, I think I've
  decided to stay for the long haul. This has meant doing things like
  furniture shopping (though not buying,) and saving for the eventual
  purchase of an apartment.

- I worked too much. But I think I accomplished
  `cool <HTTP://docs.mongodb.org/manual>`__
  `things <http://github.com/mongodb/docs-tools/>`__. In most ways, I
  think we're doing some really innovative things with documentation
  and documentation processes (and writing strong documentation for a
  cool product.) There have been struggles, as always, but it's been
  good. And a lot of work. I don't think that I would go back and
  change anything, but I do look forward to trying to establish a
  little more sanity here.

  There are other things, of course, but that covers it. It seems hard to
  avoid making resolutions, or at least articulating goals at his
  juncture:

- Keep doing the cool things that I'm doing: learning, coding, doing
  cool things at work.

- Develop a reading practice. I love reading things, but I'm not very
  good at reading regularly and keeping up with my reading habit. I'd
  like to read novels as well as stay generally on top of Asimov's (and
  potentially the New York Review of Science Fiction.)

- Develop a more extensive knitting practice. Full post on the subject
  forth coming, but I want to knit because I enjoy the activity of
  knitting and the cadence of making things like socks.
  
  I want to stop feeling like my knitting needs to have an increasing
  complexity to make it interesting, or that every thing I knit needs to
  be unique in some specific way.

- Become proficient in a programming language that isn't Python.

- Start or restart a non-day-job related writing project, and implement
  a project plan that centers on regular ongoing progress rather than
  binges.

Coming Soon: Thoughts on implementing goals.

Happy New Year!
