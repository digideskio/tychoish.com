I'm always interested in how the lessons that people learn in IT trickle
down to other kinds of work and problems. This is one of the reasons
that I [1]_ am so interested in what developers are interested in: if
you want to know what's happening in the technology space, it's best to
start at the top of the food chain. For this reason `this article from
IBM, which addresses the use of IT/Data Center management tools outside
of the data
center <http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/33945.wss>`__ was
incredibly interesting for me.

When you think about it, it makes sense. IT involves a lot of physical
assets, even more virtual assets, and when projects and systems grow big
enough, it can be easy to lose track of what you have, much less what
*state* it's in at any given time. Generalized, this is a prevalent
issue in many kinds of complex systems.

As an aside, I'm a little interested when software that provides asset
management and monitoring features, will scale down to the personal
level. That'll be interesting too. There are the beginnings of this kind
of thing (e.g. iTunes, and
`git-annex <http://git-annex.branchable.com/>`__) but only the
beginnings.

I'm left with the following questions:

- Obviously moving from managing and monitoring networked devices to
managing and monitoring infrastructure objects like water filtration
systems, storm water drainage, the electrical grid, snow removal,
etc. presents a serious challenge for the developers of these tools,
and this adaptation will likely improve the tools. *I'm more
interested in how cities improve in this equation.* And not simply
with regards to operating efficiencies. *What do we learn from all
this hard data on cities?*

- Will cities actually be able to become more efficient, or will they
need to expand to include another layer of management management,
that nullifies the advances. There are also concerns about additional
efficiency increasing the "carrying capacity of cities," into
unsustainable levels.

- Can the conclusions from automated city-wide reporting lead to
advancements in quality of service, if we're better at determining
defective practices and equipment. In this vein, how cities share
data between them will also be quite interesting.
