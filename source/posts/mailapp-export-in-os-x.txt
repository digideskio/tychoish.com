=======================
Mail.app Export in OS X
=======================

Do any of you, wise readers, have a good program that will take a bunch
of messages in a mail.app mailbox and export them to a plain text file.
I want to be able to take a lot of the messages that I don't use most of
the time, and be able to back them up, and also grep through them,
without having them clog up my mail program.

I want something that will export headers and everything, and that will
make one long text file rather than 10,000 separate files.

I have spent a little bit of time today, deleting messages that I don't
want to archive and getting my mail program organized in a more coherent
way. I'm down from about 25 mailboxes and 20 rules, to about 13 rules
and 15 mail boxes. This is an improvement. I also only have four emails
in my inbox, which is also an improvment from my usual number around 20.

But I should be doing other things.

Also, somehow, I have a working onsite subversion repository. How'd that
happen?
