Why Cloud Culture Isn't

I read this `post by Bruce Sterling about "Cloud
Culture" <http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2010/02/cloud-culture/>`__,
and haven't quite been able to formulate an appropriate response. It's
true that I often find myself ranting about this or that thing Bruce
Sterling has written, so I'm perhaps not the most impartial

To summarize, his notion is that "the cloud," as evidenced by a wealth
of usable digital information and content, combined with an uptick in
digital participation will lead to some sort of minimalistic cultural
singularity that he's calling "Cloud Culture."

Right.

So lets attack this full on. The "**Cloud**\ " is marketing dribble.
There's nothing there, it's just a different way of organizing the
servers that provide content and services on the Internet. In a lot of
way the Amazon and Rackspace "Clouds" have brute forced the server and
hosting business with utterly conventional hardware, off the shelf open
source software, and a bunch of
[insert-favorite-scripting-language-here] scripts. Oh, and a lot of
capital.

That's the back-end, and moving upwards in the stack, we'll find that
the tools (e.g. Apache, Relational Databases, Perl) that we're using now
are for the most part the same this time around as they were ten or
fifteen years ago. Sure we have new practices, and there are new
frameworks, new versions of some software, but the changes are mostly
evolutionary. Until you get to what the users see, and now we have
applications that live in web browsers, and a more robust set of
interconnected network services.

Otherwise, the cloud is just the Internet bundled up in a differed way.
And it's true that the bundling matters, but at the end of the day just
because the "cloud" presents a better way to do the work of the Internet
(in some situations,) it doesn't mean that any of the fundamental
principals have changed.

Another phenomena that hasn't changed with the cloud: we've not quite
gotten the economic system for the Internet figured out in a way that's
reliable and sustainable. New things on the Internet are supported by
capital from "old-world" industries by way of venture capital and spin
off subsidiaries. The leading business models are advertising (very
print media) and premium subscription services (which are often
contrived). So eventually it all collapses, and any gains in cultural
participation run up against the hard costs of keeping power flowing to
the servers in some way.

A few thoughts:

- We could just as easily call this whole "cloud" thing "the matrix,"
or "cyberspace," in Gibson's original formulation. Cloud is a
horrible metaphor for most things, but particularly this.

- The apparent cohesiveness of the Internet in 2010 is almost entirely
due to the success of Google. As much as we might try and avoid
Google, I *firmly* believe if Google were to go away without warning,
while the *Internet* would still work most of the economy around it
would crash and burn: people wouldn't discover new things, the
on-line advertising industry would largely collapse, a lot of the
software that a lot of people inside and outside of google use would
be without maintainers.

- I'm not sure cultural participation is problem space that can be
brute forced, and certainly the development of additional
applications in the cloud is unlikely to increase participation in a
direct manner. I'm not being an elitist and saying "cultural
participation by the unschooled and unwashed masses isn't
worthwhile," but rather cultural participation is about developing
direct relationships and making/building *things*, and that requires
forming relationships that `don't scale
well <http://tychoish.com/rhizome/conceptualizing-scale/>`__.

Thoughts?
