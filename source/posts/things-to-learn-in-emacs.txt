Things to Learn in Emacs

For my good (and yours), here's a list of things that I think I should
know how to do in emacs, but somehow don't:

- Use the version control package so that I'm not constantly popping
  between bash (terminal) and emacs to talk to git, and I don't think
  that's necessary.

- Batch renaming with Dired. It should work, it should be simple, I've
  just not gotten there.

- File specific `org-mode <http://orgmode.org>`__ settings, for
  properties, tags, and TODO keywords. I understand that it's
  possible, but my brain/system doesn't have room for that yet.
