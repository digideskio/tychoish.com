From an earlier conversation with `andy <http://tychoish.com/chris/>`__:

**andy:** they put bluetooth hardware in the ipod touch.

**tycho:** that's cool.

**andy:** but it's disabled.

**tycho:** someone will hack it

**andy:** or apple will charge for it.

**tycho:** they don't do that, really, remember the 802.11g/n upgrade,
and the iPhone Refund.

**andy:** fair enough. I kid.

**tycho:** I know... it's better than linux where, they'll make it
visible, and it'll work... about half the time, if you're standing on
your right foot.

**andy:** lol, yep: but you HAVE to stick your tongue into the
electrical socket first, and then send them the dtrace afterwards to
improve compatability which will break it with the previous human bodies

**tycho:** heh
