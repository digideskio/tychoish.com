Because I've fallen into to this rhythm of writing about what I've read
the previous day/night in the morning, I though I'd continue today.

I'm reading Tiptree's last novel/novella *`The Starry
Rift <http://www.amazon.com/Starry-Rift-James-Tiptree-Jr/dp/031293744X>`__*.
I'd been idly reading it during cereal time, and in fact I bought it a
year ago when I was buying my last bunch of text books and I thought
that it would be good to read some classic SF. I read *Brightness Falls
from the Air* this summer, and wanted to take a break before I read
though all of the Tiptree. Because you know, you should horde the
reading experience of books. (Not at all.)

It's fun, though I haven't made all that much progress yet. A couple of
things. It's very much a product of the 80's, though. The technology is
based on "tapes" as a storage method. And in a way I see the main
character as being a sort of hard core old space opera response to
cyberpunk. I'm not sure if I'm articulating that correctly. The
character has a sort of high-tech-rebel feel, except Tiptree doesn't
delight in the grunge and grit that so typifies cyberpunk/steampunk.

I'll point you to `a nifty
piece <http://cnvarbiter.livejournal.com/10627.html>`__ that I happened
to comment on a lot yesterday, `on the livejournal of Steve(n H.)
Wilson <http://cnvarbiter.livejournal.com/>`__, the writer and
instigator behind `Prometheous Radio
Theatre <http://prometheus.libsyn.com/>`__. Good stuff on writing.

With that, I don't think I'm going to have writing blogging today. There
might be knitting blogging, but my plan for the day is to write, to
knit, maybe go to the knitting guild meeting (gasp, I know!), and maybe
maybe do some work on the new TealArt.

On this last point, I had a great talk with
`Amy <http://www.domesticat.net>`__, a 'net friend from way way back,
who I've adopted as my `drupal <http://drupal.org/>`__ mentor. The bad
news is I still have a ways to go, the good news is that I haven't been
going about this in the wrong way, so with luck, there'll be a new
TealArt soon.

Onward and Upward!
