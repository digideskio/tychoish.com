I'm editing a story for *`Critical
Futures <http://criticalfutures.com/>`__* this week, and I'm
re-encountering an old problem with this novella.

There are some characters without specified genders, it's important to
their characterization, and I'm pretty wed to it, though I did slip up
and use some he/she in the first drafts, which I've since edited out.

Interestingly, or maybe not, the real effect of doing this is that the
characters don't really relate to each other's bodies. Maybe I'm just a
n00b, but I from a theoretical place it makes sense.

In any case it's really interesting, and also damn frustrating.

That is all.

Periscope down.
