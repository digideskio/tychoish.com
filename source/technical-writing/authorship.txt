Authorship Issues and Information Debt
======================================

Sometimes you can payback and prevent technical debt by deploying the
right tool or process: using the wrong tools and having limited or
inflexible processes create large amounts of information debt. Moving
outward slightly, *people* become the determining factor in
information debt. This page discusses how authorship and related
approaches to document/documentation maintenance, ownership, and
editorial responsibility affect information debt.

Diffusion of Responsibility
---------------------------

The leading problem in most :doc:`wiki` systems and resources is that
*editing* and maintenance becomes diffused. If everyone *can* edit a
resource, then no one *must*, and the documents will tend to drift
away from reality and the state of the art. The same principal is true
of overall organization. If keeping documents properly
:doc:`indexed|indexing]] and [[bucketed|bucketing` is the responsibility
of no one person, then documents will become disorganized over time
and more difficult to locate and update.

Fight diffusion of responsibility by: 

- assign information stewards. 

- provide methods of feedback that don't require users to maintain
  documents.
  
- make procedures for changing and requesting changes clear.

Editorial Unity
---------------

Style guides are essential for defining editorial guidelines and
ensuring that all text has the same voice. However, particularly for
technical documents, there's typically a large layer of style beyond
what the *Chicago Manual* and others can offer. It's important to
maintain this style-guide, but it's also important that *people*
become responsible for internalizing the style-guide and applying it
fairly. 

Establishing editorial consistency and unity takes time, commitment,
and practice on the part of a group of people doing
edits. Additionally, consistency edits are often required on a annual
or semi-annual basis of materials to ensure that style remains
consistent and fresh. You can make documents more consistent in some
ways with better tooling (e.g. templates or tools that check large
document sets for verboten formulations,) but in the end *people* must
take responsibility for the editorial unity of an information
resource.

Ownership and Access Control
----------------------------

People must be responsible for content. There are certain tasks that
someone with a firm background in the information *must*
perform. These "owners" or information stewards are the best people
for:

- Doing quality control on documents.

- Approving changes and edits to a document.

- Controlling access to a document.

- Keeping a document up to date.

- Verifying documentation releases and updates.

Sometimes it makes sense to make "subject matter experts" (SME) the
information steward and sometimes the writer can do
stewardship. Factors in deciding who should steward information:

- Are writers integrated into the research/development/engineering
  organization and process, do they operate separately?
  
- How many documents would a SME need to maintain? What kind of
  workload and availability do the SME's have?

- How isolated and independent are each individual document from
  each other? Is the information organized in a way that will even
  permit distribution of maintenance tasks?
