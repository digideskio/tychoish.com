Skills for Technical Writers
==============================
:doc:`!tag technical-writing`

Historically, I have used the collection of :technical writing
pages on the wiki to collect thoughts and specifications on the
documentation process and tool chain. More recently with the
:doc:`/technical-writing/documentation-sucks` page, I've been thinking more about
documentation processes and how to manage and work with technical
writers in the context of software development teams. 

I've started thinking more about the skills and work patterns that
help technical writers succeed, the management approaches that work,
and the way that the documentation process can interact with and
compliment the development process. This thinking has been inspired by
a couple of my own job searches over the past year. 

Open questions include: 

- What kinds of backgrounds prepare people for being technical
  writers? 

  I think the work I do is really important and quite valuable to
  companies, and while I'm really grateful that there is no "technical
  writing degree" that I could have obtained to be able to do the kind
  of work I do, it makes it harder to convince people that you're the
  right person for their job.
  
- What kind of research can organizations do to be able to understand
  what needs to be documented and to what depth or for what
  audiences? 

  "Go forth and write documentation of *xyz* software," rarely makes
  anyone happy, at the same time there's no real use in documenting
  everything because it's there. 
  
- How do you determine if someone without a technical writing
  background is "too close," to the product and the development
  process to be able to provide useful perspective?   

  Outsider dynamics are really helpful--I think--to writing good
  technical materials. At the same time some context is useful.
  
- What parts of the technical writing process can benefit (or suffer)
  from :doc:`automation`? And as a corollary, what parts of documentation
  projects can developers be expected to do?

More forthcoming...
