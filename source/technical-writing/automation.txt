Automation and Technical Writing
================================

In response to :doc:`/posts/technical-writing-appreciation`:

   Back in the 70s and 80s -- and maybe still, but I doubt it -- there
   were consulting companies that would approach large companies (like
   Wang, which I worked for at the time and which was a very large
   company at the time) claiming to have this magic method/tool that
   would pretty much serve the very needs of the system you imagine --
   basically a set of forms with focused questions that the developers
   would fill in and from this documents would be automatically
   generated WITHOUT THE NEED OF TECHNICAL WRITERS AT ALL!

   Asshole mid-level managers back in the high-flying days when large
   companies consisted almost entirely of mid-level managers thought
   this sounded really great. Of course, like a perpetual motion
   machine, the concept ignored the reality of things like friction. In
   this case the friction was the fact the in order for a developer to
   produce this information -- particularly in the format required,
   with the precise definition of audiences and user interface -- a
   developer would have to spend 50 to 70 percent of his or her working
   time working on the documentation.

   I think in one exasperated moment I offered a mid-level manager a
   thousand dollars if he could get even one developer to fill out even
   one sample page, just to see how this might play out. I think I
   might have tempered my request by saying that if he couldn't he'd
   have to raise my salary by a thousand dollars for every subportion
   of the document template left blank or not properly done to spec.
   
   The answer to your question still lies in good product
   specifications that define audience and interface early in the
   development -- what the outcome will be, externally, not how the
   cool internal coding will manifest. Have I ever seen one of these,
   in thirty years? Not really."
