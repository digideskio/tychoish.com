Inclusion Management Tools

Some kind of text reuse functionality is built into most documentation
publication tool kits. The ability to do includes is important, but
using inclusion always adds complexity and may be difficult to
manage.

To help manage this complexity we try to store all included files in an
"includes" directory and use a clear naming system for those
files, but actually using and editing included files safely requires a
bit *more*. Including the ability to dynamically generate lists that
report:

1. the mapping of an included file to the files that include it.

2. a list of files that are only included in one location.

3. a list of included resources that aren't included in any source file.

4. a list of files that are included in other files that *also*
   include files themselves.

With tools like these available text inclusion becomes potentially
manageable, and it becomes easy to make changes to included files
easily without worrying about the unintended consequences of a change.
