===================================
Filtered Documentation Processing
===================================

The processing of documentation, particularly with :doc:`dexy`, revolves
around the idea of "filtering" documents. Processing documents can be
complex, and although structured document forms can ease the
burden. Processing documents by way of a series of filters, makes
sense because a series of filters is easy to understand and is also
simple to manipulate and extend as needs change.

There are a number of different approaches to processing and filtering
documentation, and a lot of commentary on the subject. Dexy is a great
example of this, but other resources and contributions to this
discussion follow:
