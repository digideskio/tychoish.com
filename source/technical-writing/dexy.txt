Dexy

`Dexy <http://dexy.it>`_ is a new tool for handling the process of the
documentation work flow between *writing* and publication. It takes
snippets of code, and bits of documentation and passes these atomic
chunks through filters to generate technical articles, manuals, and
other high quality resources. It's exciting because it *may* provide a
way to write and manage the documentation process in a manner that is
more effective than many other options *and* has the potential to
produce better quality technical texts.
